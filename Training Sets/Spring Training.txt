she lifts her head
a tapping at the window
is only rain
rain
opening the window
a light heart
a south wind
polishing my face clean
for this journey
spring winds
the old lady tries again
to tidy her hair
spring mists
on these long evenings
someone's coming
an unknown boat
coming into the harbor
touches me
walking to work
our sleeves touch
starch on silk
asking for a ride
his answer dotted
with music
static electricity
garbled introductions
they lean together
panty hose
she crosses her legs
with whispers
woman and her pillow
curled around a notebook
dawn's first light
light
imprinting the stone
rings
as one of us
the child watches
an earthworm
warm under quilts
the young couple lie quiet
in the place of one
rain drops
falling around the bed
her hair pins
his body a bow
his arrow shot me
full of flowers
spring storms
at their climax
thunder rolls away
rain shower
afterwards he reads to me
all of his poems
eyes
into eyes
lights
after lovemaking
all is quiet until
rain begins again
a woman's cry
the shower begins
with lightning
orgasm
an explosion of flowers
in wind chimes
tangled in sleep
on a sea weed strewn beach
lovers
flooded river
sides flowing together
lovers touch
dripping
spring rain and your body
in mine
driftwood lair
lovers hidden from view
found by the wind
lying in a river
words of love
in the current
rain
idle fingers strumming
the dulcimer
one ear
listening to the river
wet with rain
rain dripping
one hour
into another
these long days
watching the sky fade
with closed eyes
river winds
flipping white pages
without poems
rain erases time
one hour reused
the whole day long
in this rain my house
a stone in the stream
I a female fossil
scattered
among driftwood
drifters
touching his face
the slope of her forehead
echoes
new friends meet
snow-melt streams
into the river
walking
the river comes
along too
meeting an old friend
at the mountain stream
a bear
silence
around lovers
a silver cord
lovers in church
giggling at the term
immaculate
afternoon rain
into my sleep
your pencil moves
book covers
renewing a friendship
somewhat faded
clipboard
unable to tell
your poem from mine
daybreak
the person you love
is not perfect
without love
sea kelp growing
a holdfast
alone
but not alone
the sun - the moon
so easy to love
yet she always fumbles
locks and keys
organ drone
mother's warning
about choirboys
rain complaining
of the steepness of the lane
to his lover's house
parting
at the river
weeping willows
unwanted child
wearing a name
that doesn't fit
crying at dawn
gulls
and a lonely woman
morning fog
dreams not buried
deep enough
spring sunshine
the strangeness of his perfectly
normal thumbnail
sunny sea winds
shoulders ache
for the want of wings
kids laughing
in the neighbor's house
the childless couple
moonlight moving
with the gate as the servant girl
takes an evening
unemployed carpenter
l-o-v-e
tattooed on his knuckles
Saturday rain
the desire to buy something
extravagant
Saturday rain
desire by a warm stove
for an affair
static electricity
a silken sleeve is drawn
to the amber
white surf
wanting to keep the ocean
free of oil wells
waterfall
delicate forms
for a spirit
buying
Scotch magic tape
as it were
dinosaur claws
taken to a rocky beach
a dreaming mind
ballet movies
all night her dreams
tip-toe
dreaming I was
the sleeve of your coat
I learned your secret
acrobat family
mine - if I ran away
to the circus
roar of the surf
sleeping on the beach
a child dreams
napping
among driftwood logs
sleeping
awakening
furniture
with chipped veneers
up and down
driftwood lairs of lovers
come and go
tide pool still
as if it is tomorrow
I'm not here
fading
condolence cards
the sting
sea spray
a rock writes
another name
spirals
the world tied together
with double helixes
a watch
left out in the rain
timeless
three fingertips
pressed to a cheek telling
of a new love affair
tide turns
leaping white into the cove
our eyes
raindrops
in a waterfall
glory-rush
surf's surge and boom
brushing my teeth
in a stranger's bathroom
each white wave
mounts the black rock
differently
waves crash
in the trickling away
another crests
hour by hour
the wave-white sea
becomes the wind
spring run-off
a little more - a little less
humans get so excited
waist
long-gone encircles
a child
rented house
the ocean's roar
in mother's womb
tugging at my sleeve
the a wind a voice
saying mommy!
the widow
taking swimming lessons
from the life guard
on a bridge
a young couple discuss
old lovers
nest
the fullness of spring
with eggs
lunch
time by the brook
spring-fed
always further
down the road frogs
and the dark
on the long pier
a tall father tells his son
how deep the ocean is
winds on the beach
going inland to remind you
of my love
thin and pale
the air of spring
leaving in flowers
smooth seas
upon jagged shores
the power
a love affair
building a fire
in a strange stove
the new couple
one looks upstream
the other down
dropping sticks
in the flooded river
their fortune
rivers
taking care of us
small fishes
earth
each spot layered
with stories
sunshine
on the hobo's back
hitchhiking
song
from a fence post
meadow lark
the night is shortened
by your letters on the pillow
here beside me
coming together
your nearness
my music
the road before us
departing clouds bright
with a rising sun
so much rain
this year how the kids
have grown
turning green
each wave crests
higher than the last
thunder
his first date
not hers
spring rain
your gentleness seems to know
no sorrow
to off-shore rocks
spring comes rowing
lovers in a boat
parents
showing the newborn
to the rising sun
lips
take from the springs
whistling
cut crystal rainbow
shining where he wanted
to touch her
warming
her feelings of love
the hot springs
ducks
paddling around
lovers
invisible thrusting
the mountain raises
all of us
flooded river
rubbing low skies
electric current
a woman's slit
sliding over granite
a spring
spring
the urge to scratch
the earth with a hoe
randy again
her voice on the phone says
he wants me
treasured gift
her smooth stone calls
as the phone rings
gentle breathing
night rain comes alive
tapping on the window
society dame
flirts with an unreal cowboy
her teenage romance
dawn's faint hour
awakens under closed eyes
a shiver of pictures
desiring you
rain drums
in my ears
love duet
everyone in the music class
crosses their legs
pearl buttons
undoing her blouse
two soft ones
patterns
your words open
the iris
tumbling surf
water voices of children
within the womb
heavy surf
that sound I heard before
being born
soft things
inheriting a pattern
in time
desert wind
naked as the crack
where I was born
silence
baby's blue eyes
without tears
fingerprints
the tiny scars
for life
lying in your lap
the dense smell of musk
a birthday gift
the poise of coming
forward waves on a beach
a baby's first steps
this need to love
mountains give to spring
flowers
downpour
your fingers
inside me
sun setting
emerald waves free
our passion
illuminated
in the light from the barn
their first kiss
rain
pounding in love
all night
rain on the roof
wet around us
on the sheets
kisses
in your open mouth
the rest of you
in and out
of the river's mouth
a tongue of sea
opening my legs
to the flooded river
currents meet
jerking off
the love scene played
by marionettes
deep humming
waves unrolling
the bay
relaxed
cherry flowers unfold
peace
across the fence
with his cherry in bloom
I can forgive him
planting peas
a harvest today
of peace
asleep
morning seas quiet
pink
raised up
within the protection
a mountain unfolding
a touch of silk
caressing her body
glistening sperm
vacation
utterly exhausted
by pleasure
local flirt
two pair of wool socks
below a backless dress
standing still
his glance begins
the dance
silence
between eyes
love lights
her hem
the wind lifts
a little fog
giving him
a bite of her
oldest apple tree
deep sea green waters
sheltered by a cove slipping
into something frothy
rented house
rows of ocean waves
seem unfaithful
a strange house
the new nightgown
seems unfaithful
a young girl
chewing gum in conversation
with herself
river childhood
banging a bucket
boat sides
tea house
a child feds the koi fish
his fortune
how proudly it waves
the American flag T-shirt
on her young breasts
wet dreams
the man in the moon
was once young
high mountain village
church organ reedy as willows
the noisy brook
telephone call
the addressed Easter card|
not to be sent
Easter morning mountain
my shadow crosses
Death Valley
Easter Sunday
hikers arrive
in Cathedral Canyon
after the storm
a sunny Easter morning
finds opals
atheists' vacation
Easter weekend
in Death Valley
fibers
so fine mornings
green the air
before it comes
the knowing of rain
in the air
sea air
each cell fills
with salt water
morning air
tightly rolled
in her curlers
morning breeze
in the flooded river saying
find a spring green stone
morning breeze
coming in the window
surf sounds
clouds
the sky divided
into puddles
waves
churning up high
clouds
clouds
touching the sea
with rain
free to fly
some of the ocean
in wind-driven colors
wispy clouds
splashed across the sky
sea foam
a point of land
breaking through the clouds
sunshine
pines
under great white mountains
clouds
changing forms
all around the Buddha
clouds in a blue sky
clouds
flooding the river
with spring
spring cloud melt
flooding river willows
green leaves
journeying
spring clouds blow over
packed suitcases
rolling down
rounded ridges
rain clouds
a cloudy day
the silky softness
of fresh-washed hair
spring winds
between the tops of bent grass
bottoms of clouds
silence
in high winds a cloud
turns around
wispy clouds
a white-water view
of the sky
the pyramid
morning fog and sun
slanted by redwoods
treetops green
leaving in fog
clean blue
a winter heart
flying into spring
low clouds and fog
sunrise
pouring into the valley
fog
cliff side
the edge of fog
bright green
step by step
a hole in the fog
walking away
moon radiance
filling the river valley
fog
sea fog
darken the trampled grass
beach path at dawn
on the green hill
piles of dark clouds
full of hailstones
after lovemaking
hail falls between us
she buttons her blouse
a hazy moon
pinpointed by the lights
of fishing boats
silence
wafted by light
many colors
a range of light
morning colors flow
out of the high Sierras
morning light
the sound of waves
on your sleeping face
without lights
the brightness of a blue sky
full of stars
dawn's faint hour
squeezes in heart-run veins
light in every limb
light touching
where only rain goes
trespassing
tides
light comes and goes
as ocean
first light
the cove still dark
with low tide
dawn light
rocks and water
full of fire
wings of dawn
birds unfolding
the light
the dark moon
pulls out of the ridge
morning light
stars bend down
morning seas light
dawn
ocean so wide
and weighty
yet dancing with light
sunrise
out of two feet comes eight
foot long shadows
crack of dawn
the thin line
of birds peeping
curving an ember
of a not space place
crack of dawn
morning waves
to burnished water
a radiance
ancient cypress
leaning over the light
at sunrise
morning bright
meets cabin cold
on quilted mountains
as is the dark
without the sound of rain
the room grows cold
April weather
all the changes
leave us cold
spring presses
cold into shadow
shapes
curve of the sea
cupping her breasts
cold hands
still cold
spoons in the sandbox
all empty
shining glass
of unlit kerosene lamps
this long evening
expanding the warmth
the yellow flowers
of longer days
old snow
soften by bird song
a longer day
a long day
unfolding rock crevices
with light
the long day
holding my eyes
against the sky
rocks give way
morning light rolls over
eastern peaks
morning
drawing lines on the sea
one for the horizon
morning
wetted by the light splash
of small waves
morning
side of the mountain
awake
early morning
the weight of paper
waiting for poems
ocean terrace
lifting to the north-born fog
morning
morning light
dreams climb the dark wall
of the obelisk
yawning
sea fog in the valley
rolls into morning
morning sun
pulled over the ridge
by sleepy eyes
morning sun
coming down the cliff
the ocean night
morning fire
blazed forth at last
sun through the fog
a morning moon
your face in sleep
turned to the wall
a calm sea
refusing to accept
the morning moon
balanced at dawn
a full moon slides into the sea
without ripples
too perfect
the day moon rises
from snow-capped peaks
wild surf
tears in the night
a tender new moon
morning
a touch of sea waves
and the moon melts
sea light
filling the valleys
with mist
moving against mist
crumbles from the cliff
stream down
pink misty mountains
gather between the peaks
the rising sun
morning mist
filling the spaces
of night birds
lacking a redness
the gray mist of morning
not yet an argument
mists
leaving the lake
high
fire angels
river mists at dawn
manifest
ocean roar
at the open window
a breath of mist
mist
softens the hills
incoming waves
passing of spring
water trickles over rock
into the koi pond
a wooden gate
the sky begins to crumble
the upright posts
narrow brook
in pouring rain
the smallness
rain
falling in the brook
once again
salt shaker
in dawn's pearly light
the pouring rain
in this rain my house
a stone in the stream
I a female fossil
March rains
filling the zodiac
with fish
running from the hill
the haste of rain water
in twisted paths
tops of waves
on mountain ridges
rain
such a rain!
changing into
a clean nightgown
falling
with the rain
into bed
rain
coming to the wakeful
sleep sounds
waves
wind flowing over mountains
in rain
a sound falling
in the night bird feathers
spring rain
falling
the amount of rain
in a haiku
sky waters
young between trees
on a high wind
spring rain
the night sound
of bird feathers
after the storm
a thing in the dark
somewhere drips
rain clouds
the tide turns
small ripples
a rippled pool
a rain cloud falling
into the sea
round puddle
in spaces between raindrops
circles
edge of the roof
raindrops dripping off
seconds of the night
raindrops
drowning in the pool
rings as tombs
raindrops
wetting rocks dried
by low tide
spin drift
the setting sun
in a rainbow
segments
morning rainbows
in a wet net
clouds
drifting into sea foam
rainbows
rainbridge
crossing the river
rainbow
after a shower
stars also shine
brighter
May showers
the wind so gentle
rain is round
April showers
your sticky diamonds
dry on my leg
a white wave breaks
in the death of tumult
a rainbow
morning faces
ocean and sky
soften pink
waves breaking
a paler blue washes
across the sky
line of mountains
stretching the eye
a clear sky
for the maiden dance
light fluffy flakes
of April snow
snow mixing
my breath
with spring
a morning moon
nearly touching Venus
with my finger
darkness
dawn light enters
filled with stars
faithful 'till sunrise
of all the heavenly lights
only the morning star
morning stars
alone with me
the beach
morning stars
the call of the sea
over the dunes
in the morning sun
thousands of night stars
still in the dew
still a few stars
as if they will stay
all morning
in the marrow
of my own bones
a morning star
forest clearing
a circle of stars
spinning out
sunshine
making light of it
salt water wave
opening the cave
the morning sun
slips in
filling the bay
an incoming tide
of sunshine
silence
in a rain shower
sunshine
in spring sunshine
around the granite stones
spaces green
sunlight
in a slurp of coffee
Sunday morning
on the far ridge
an arch of fire burns
into Sunday
morning sun
creeping from up to down
in the sleeping holes
sunrise
coming thru the mountain pass
a yellow line
ocean sunrise
the colors of a grandson
running on the beach
sunrise
slipping into view
bird songs
the sun rises
petting a yellow cat
with warmth
walking east
drawn to that place
the sun rises
sun rise
giving me a new name
and a shadow
first day of spring
on the calendar
by the snowy window
rising from earth
the spring equinox moon
grows round
desert springs hot tub
the canyon rim warms
with spring's first dawn
spring equinox
fitting into winter
a saucer and cup
double helix
earth hangs
in a woven net
coming inside
spring wind has filled
my pockets with cold
wind
rubbing the lake
the wrong way
sea winds
smells diluted by distance
flow thin as light
lace curtains
whipped by spring winds
billows of clouds
cloud wind
blowing colors in and out
of the ocean
high winds
memories
of flight
stars bend down
into the wind of whitecaps
morning light
no trespassing sign
torn down by spring winds
the open sky road
a south wind
ironing work shirts on the line
at thirty knots an hour
