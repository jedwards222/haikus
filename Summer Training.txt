wind perfumed
from a woman's shoulder
desert night
leaving the beach
only she has sand
on her back
sand
where lovers laid
a shallow depression
summer sun
drops of sweat mingle
with sperm
eyelids closed
the naked sleepers
curled into fish
lying naked
open to summer stars
this old couple
the whole bed
yet he lays his head
in my hand
sea fog
hiding morning-mussed hair
places you've kissed
sweeping the floor
sunrise on papers
left by lovers
he's angry again
alone on the porch
with a red star
hot air
his arguments
on my face
crumpled silence
after the argument
moth wings
our angry silence
old faithful geyser
blows off steam
this heat
the harp too
out of tune
the neighbor lady
scolding her child
is also god
picking up sleep
where you left it at dawn
afternoon nap
sun from the east
ocean waves from the west
our entertainment
dancing on the beach
I jab a stick into the sky
to break up the blue
white dance
in the beach walk skirt
folds of moonlight
I come to you clothed
only in the dampness of fog
and our dancing
hard glances
the sun on the sea
a virile man
she
showing him a sea cave
and more
almond nails
pressed into brown skin
a faint perfume
moon lights
houses of hermit crabs
my damp blanket
star paths
the tender roots
of passion
voices
bridging the stream
stepping stones
your voice
tying me to the desert
toast pops up
airport phone call
the heart leaves
without luggage
flying
the mountains bend down
to our meeting
koi dart and hide
from the net dipped
coming of autumn
departing summer
and when it's gone
the river's low
one leaf floats
in the sand castle's moat
end of summer
circus acrobats
come to the end of summer
leaping and falling
asleep in a boat
to dream the dreams
of water lilies
desert nights
the clarity of dreams
warm and real
dream dancer
sleeping without a pillow
on scarred boards
remembering a dream
and then the circus
was over
eyes closed
knowing by heart
the rest
days so complete
words become the calls of birds
the high tide wind
only borrowed
this summer day
this beach
wet silk
cupping her breast
night river
outdoor shower
bathed in sun colors
of hot water
slipping into the pool
naked divides the night
sun-warmed waters
gentle nights
of desert wind
a woman's breast
touching myself
your name
on my lips
placing the flute
against her lips something
slips into place
British pub
an unfaithful man blows
suds from his beer
getting into bed
the stranger
even browner
eating melon
bites given on the point
of his knife
the blood circle
mother and daughter wading
in the surf
I'm not old
all night my eyes have held
the ancient stars
with the ocean's roar
I climb the hills home
not alone
sweeping bare floors
the summer empty cabin
very full
glowing
a flag unfurls
native happiness
long summer day
how many animals
I've been
on a bright sunny day
comes your smiling face
light added to light
just two stars
yet our eyes are closed
in ecstasy
high cliff
the heart beats the blue sky
like a flaying stick
kissing
together in a glass
our toothbrushes
desert kisses
hotter
than ever before
morning stars fade
waking a small bird
our lips
summer night
empty mountain road filled
with our laughter
laughter added to the heat
my lover's farts can't kill
mosquitoes
angel wings
propelled through the air
by laughter
tongue
tasting
pink
shapes
pure light the face
of a loved one
blue spots
tattooed with love
from his teeth
lovers
pulse of fire gods
in bubbling waters
lovers
cradled in caves
lovers
hot tongues
the little language
of lovers
lovers
the lamp lighted lane
a way away
nights
the grove of little trees
swollen with lovers
moon white water
lovers in the secret cove
Saturday night
just as tangled
paths in the berry patch
lovers
lovers
heat of a summer night
fill the moon
making love
the unevenness of boards
on the porch
skin
touching
whispers
a butterfly
from your finger
light touches
following wet tracks
into the secret garden
he enters
hovering hums
mosquitoes watch us
making love
packing
between unworn shirts
sea sounds
moments of forever
beach day chitin
fossil in lava
gazing into fires
seals in my mind
wind-water pictures
red marks
from your white teeth
mosquito bites
curving sandstone cliffs
the yellow school bus
where time stands still
memories
over a river of sunlight
a time bridge
the narrow bed
we breath each other
all afternoon
on bare arms
the noon-day sun melted
hot metal sweet
before the summer storm
rises the close smell
of two skins
after paying
the whore seems to be
someone's sister
applause
scenery painted
by a one-armed boy
company's coming
over-friendly flies
buzzing at the door
prostitute
now a freeway rest area
her mother's home
finally it's Friday
the passion flower blooms
wrinkling the bedspread
crawling on the bed
tendrils of passion flowers
thick on the porch
shadows of leaves
cover the open holes
her flute forgotten
the sun and hunger
watches without winding
on a summer day
tourist fear
the ocean will ruin
Land's End clothes
clasped hands
holding the nervousness in
his thumbs
in rain in sun
how do you run from your hours
window box zinnia?
shelling peas
the pregnant woman asks
"Is forty old?"
silence
in a knot hole
stares
traveling through
Basho in your town
you in mine
beach party
losing in the sand
her many years
a world closed
the roar of surf
plugs my ears
quiet evening
all the wind
back in the flute
on vacation
the summer sun
far out to sea
summer stars
finding all the familiar things
edged with morning
campfire embers
all the demons nearly gone
in the morning sun
distance softens
and rounds the hills
our relationship
his penis in her
lightning strikes
very close
a gentle rain
in me
your poems
curve of a wave
holding perfect
a summer day
satisfaction
the cooling breeze
between lovers
my head
resting on the pillow
of your voice
we share these hours
gifts with many small parts
complete together
beaches where no one goes
their share of sand
gentle waves
tiny cabin
distant shelter of woods
and sky within me
caught between rocks
seaweed in the rising tide
seems to wave to me
smooth sand
following waves
back to the sea
summer weary
the sky leans down an arch
of cypress
asleep
holding your breath
in my hand
beach-blown
my sea-foam body
awaits your hand
hot night
legs spread wide
where sleep should be
neon lights blink
glances pass underneath
dark lashes
hung over the bed
the unpainted painting
mosquito netting
swirling dust
excitement flickers
within the tent
circus
red flags flutter
hearts
acrobats
unfolding the circus tent
first
outdoor circus
in the center ring
a butterfly
juggling sunshine
on clapping hands
little red hearts
outdoor circus
sun on the brightest costumes
fading
family circus
acrobats lifted high
on joined hands
champion
on the flying trapeze
a butterfly
hearts flying
on the high trapeze
a blond young man
trapeze artists
catching the sun
each other
mountain village
in the one-ring circus
a balance act
juggler
the children's eyes
in his hands
juggling illusions
the circus man
with many balls
circus bleachers
old enemies crowd
close together
circus
backstage the heat
everyone squirms
tinsel flash
under shiny sweat
goose bumps
magic act
wondering where the scarf went
when the wind blew
high wire act
on the ground children dance
arms outstretched
intermission
all the real clowns stand up
and smile
between acts
the quiet music
of bowing trees
clown act
without a tent
the wind as wild
part of the joke
clapping for stagehands
who fix the pole
empty morning light
the trampled grass circle
of the circus tent
dog days
a bitch in heat
laceless shoes
a field of stars
square and curved
the American flag
sea winds
cutting into a blue sky
a square of flag
Independence Day
all the fireworks
in your eyes
sparklers
in the night sky
stars
sun burnt
and from fireworks
star-crazy
patriots
etched in their eyes
sparklers
sea shells
and sky rockets
beach holiday
another wave
the last sparkler
a bent wire
Independence Day
the empty flagpole
poking stars
Independence Day
the lower road bridge
collapses
two crows
and a sea gull having someone
else's picnic
Independence Day
the county courthouse
blown sky-high
Independence Day
the parade majorette
with the shorter skirt
holiday
a marshmallow wind
on browning bodies
5th of July
the portable ice chest
drying inside out
a single mom
the paper days until
school is out
summer breeze
the shouts out of school
children again
summer skies
the clearness of children's voices
out of school
school picnic
someone very young teaches him
to boogie
school picnic
the ticket seller raises her fingers
as she adds
Mid-summer's Eve
lately bracken fern
invisible
mid-summer
day and night balanced
no wind
a broken shoe string
summer begins
barefoot
holes in the hammock
thoughts run through
my mind unfiltered
black pine
against the never dark sky
Mid-summer's Eve
Midsummer's Eve
her brief white gown
shortens the night
seaside vacation
unwinding the kite string
unwinding
in desert sand
cinder temples seem to be
from China
Grand Canyon
tourists sucked out of California
by a big hole
Grand Canyon
deeper with each camera click
the tourists' smile
in the roar
of Yosemite Falls photos
kids' scared smiles
under Cathedral Spires
two ancient Sequoias
and a trash bin
quacking ducks
on my favorite beach
tourists coming
clouds come and go
just as quickly on the beach
tourists
Lake Tahoe
tired eyes stare down
at a tiny rivulet
desert poverty
even dirt has been left
in the casino
bare tops
Death Valley tourists
on a hot day
tourists
overlooking Badwater
each with a Coke
tourists in Italy
Pan's pipes and the Crucifix
in one museum
out-of-season tourists
at San Juan Capistrano
hummingbirds
scenic spots
full of a century
of tourists' eyes
mountain gorge
before the great view falling
asleep
snobbish hotel
the rusty old cars
of employees
around the pool
their nipples exposed
men!
mountain river
shriveled to harmlessness
summer tourists
surf sounds
then my motel neighbor
turns off the shower
lying on the bed
layered with other lives
motel night
motel morning
the strange bird's song
in another migration
vacation
finally relaxing
fog dissolves
vacation ends
one last splash of a wave
I am gone too
drowsy-colored
the summer afternoon
weighs nothing
desert air
invisible smoke of sagebrush
clear
softness
desert air flows
through giant rocks
coming to sea cliffs
the off-shore breeze raises
a flower fragrance
beach tent billows
in the summer blue
white clouds
desert sounds
out of the sun's way
clouds moving
morning downpour
raised to new heights
afternoon clouds
dancing lights
clouds sprinkle the sun
across water
clouds
colored by open wall
a driftwood lair
curving with the land
a rainbow of clouds
moves out to sea
ocean clouds
here and there
a sailor's wish
sea clouds
film long exposed to
a white water river
shell-shaped
the highest peaks
swirl clouds
majestic peaks
making majestic clouds
we shield our eyes
clouds
canyon walls
of Yosemite
thunder
rolling up the mountain
great white clouds
after the rain
breathing deeply
white valley clouds
western peaks
the last clouds
set afire
between boards
shadows on a sunny porch
a slender coolness
light
rippling the lake
with coolness
the August moon
rises with the coolness
of a thunderstorm
daylight
in paths of falling stars
flights of birds
alone
climbing the afternoon peaks
the day moon
sparkling
on bright water
unseen day stars
first light
pouring into lava mountains
cloud red
dawn
with the light
winds
morning sun
the twinkle of stars
still in the dew
sudden downpour
now we outdoor folks
own a waterbed
drought white
a withered tree hangs
over the bath tub
unearthly
silence of a drought year
drying
constipation
from dry desert winds
only farts
rustling on the roof
leaves of a drought year
in the rain gutter
behind me
fog closes in
the Golden Gate
ocean fog
hangs in the pine trees
a white hammock
sunrise finds
fog in the valleys
fingers in sand
fog
the sun and I shout
the morning
evening fog
a door slams
softly
crackle of paper
an afternoon of shopping
the heat
hot night
sleep too
has melted
vibrating crystals
the heat
moving mountains
heat waves
bringing to the desert
an ocean view
heat wave
the nautilus shell
unwinds
a high wave
bumping the horizon
curled by blue
evening
drawing a line of pink
mountains
on the horizon
waves by the buoy
bump the sky
incoming tide
covers sun blackened rocks
with a hot day
sun in a towel
drying a wet body
the hot day
summer light
spun into a handmade rug
lambs wool
gazing at sunset
the dark road home
filled with light
last light
rising out of the cliff
seven gulls
today's light
goes into the sea
an open window
power lines
lacing the sky
with electricity
out of darkness
that covers stars
lightning
forked lightning
the river begins
in the sky
car lights curve
nights along the coast
flashes of lightning
in a streak
lightning across the floor
a scorpion
long day
waiting for the cove
to fill with water
longer day
the sun lingers
in the warmth
moonlight
unfolded from clean sheets
covers the bed
moonlight
a child's high voice
above the darkness
pink and blue
birth of ocean-sky
morning
nearly awake
sea-gathered morning
on sleeping faces
morning light
things of the day
taking shape
morning light
the open eyes
of basket shadows
springing up
into colorful cliffs
morning sun
morning winds
eases the slender moon
from the ridge
noon clouds
on lava mountains
burned shapes
noon clouds
a dark spirit shape
on lava buttes
noon sun
straight down
the steep cliff
noon
turning low hills
into clouds
noon-day sun
rolling the fog out to sea
the round ball
as night
the bump and thump
of ocean waves
night lights
in the secret cove
moonlit sea foam
nights
showing us inside
mountains
desert lake
night enters the blue
coolness
evening skies
in a high mountain lake
open to night
nights
a window
to another world
partly cloudy
packing the few things
to leave the ocean
summer rains
the umbrella also
wet waiting for you
vacation
the weather report
all wet
summer rains
drumming
your fingers in me
rain stops
we sleep
still dripping
whisper of rain
on a sunny day the surf
wets my feet
late summer rain
surprising
an open window
rain lets up
colors come to life
with a breath of wind
clouds
curved in sea foam
rainbows
waterfall
completing the rainbow
a woman's body
waterfall
coming apart
rainbows
rainbow hour
across the lake
mountains of sun
out of a wave
rainbows of high tide
arching wind
under rain clouds
the far valley full of light
at sunset
broken rain clouds
one sunset slips
into another
broken rain clouds
slanted sunset light
moving mountains
low clouds
skirting the mountain
a line of white
ragged rain clouds
blurring the sharpness
of lava peaks
sweeping the porch
bright prints of raindrops
followed by splashes
desert wash
variegated stones speckled
with raindrops
hot humid day
in a sudden breeze
raindrops of wind chimes
wind
in a dry riverbed
raindrops
towers of rising sun
spread over the dark lake
wispy clouds
short night
colors of a sighing
in the wind
painting skies
soft hills brush clouds
warm colors
evening colors
fire rock mountains
enter the sky
evening skies
the pink of hills rises
above them
evening blue
shadows from the hills
float to the sky
without stars
the sky eases pink
into the lake
drifting out to sea
sky colors warmed
in the hills
between the two elms
how that patch of blue changes
in the high wind
a south wind
the yellow cat lies down
under a chair
fire-white halo
at the moment of eclipse
I notice your face
solar dust
visible during eclipse
all over the room
dappled forest floor
the eclipsed sun
in a myriad of leaves
under trees
a thousand crescent suns
eclipsed by leaves
spindrift
falling into the sea
stars
between stars
harp chords stringing
unearthly lights
sleepless
another bright star descends
into sea mist
glass in granite
tide pools glitter
stars
all the stars
at my feet
the flashlight wavers
crossing darkness
of deep space
each star
flat sea night
faint wake of clear eyes
gazing star to star
Venus and the moon
in conjunction with
my blankets and me
twinkling with laughter
stars
my old flashlight
low desert campfire
a shower of sparks
again stars
white water
the path to the valley
full of stars
a window opens
on the midnight sea
all the stars
a shower of stars
dampened by the roar
of a wave
a rim
of wild foaming surf
crab nebula
high winds
stars spinning by
in perfect circles
Venus
watching you sleep
with me
into the sea
a shower of stars
dark edge of land
night sky
so filled with stars
gulls do sleep
open window
stars drift in
on sea mist
stars
in a basket broken
on white stones
my staring eyes
creating in the night sky
one star after another
stars
scratched in the night
light wheels
sunset
the show begins
with stars
velvet nights
the desert wind
warm with stars
a blaze
out of the big dipper
a shooting star
sharing the night
atop a remote mountain
the brightest star
extinguished
a candle leaves the night
filled with stars
summer night
every star
also hot
hot night
all the stars out
naked
counting stars
these two small eyes
close in sleep
night of stars
on her lips his
stars of night
twinkling stars
splashes of light
on dark wet oars
August night
the melon moon seeding
the stars
riddles
the stars
answer
woods so still
one can hear the stars
burning close
storm purple hills
grass green hills pinned
with a wet blue fence
summer moon
feeling our love
warm the night
summer moon
in our eyes
only each other
summer moon
listening to our words
hides in the pines
summer moon-viewing
kids squat in a circle
to knuckle-shoot marbles
meeting the moon
on ash meadows
summer hiker
melted a hole
the moon slipped in
a summer sky
summer moon
on the tails of fireflies
fire flies
summer moon
a jar of fireflies
by a sleeping child
hot weather
the inflated moon rises
in the heat
seaside sun
burnished by waves
salt air
hot tub
a blazing sun
enters the ocean
rolling east to west
the desert sun flattens
low hills
cooling shadows
the curve of rock
around the sun
desert sun
greeting the morning
in a hot tub
purple skies
melting into lava peaks
sun glow
without wind
desert sun slides into
the narrowest crack
dark brown
the desert sun tans
wooden buildings
golden granite
rolls to the horizon
a desert sun
desert sun
on leafless things
growing
cloudy sunrise
all the bird song colors
on rounded raindrops
a warm glow
over lava mountains
sunrise
morning rise
the desert sun comes
cooled
to return
to this place the sun
rises higher
waiting for sunset
the eastern hills redden
at our impatience
sunset
from below the canyon

back into his shadow

on riverside cabins
windows of water
back in their cars

in the tourist's eyes
sunsets
into a valley
a column of light
sunset
a vacation ends
in the sea

coming home at sunset
fire gods
on the stairs
the sinking sun
climbs up again
sunset
a western range rises
as night sky
sunshine
a path through mountains
east to west
beach houses
blowing bright sunshine
between them
desert salt lake
preserving the last
sunlight
off and on
the message of sunlight
on a calm lake
sunlight
the yellow tablecloth
rumpled by our laughter
blown about
by magnetic storms
sun spots draw us
stuttering
rolls from hill to hill
thunder
Yosemite falls
thunderheads gather
more at the top
electricity
into tree roots
thunder
heavy thunder
dropping down
of light rain

yet on the far ridge sunset
perfect stillness

in the stovepipe
soot falls

on remote mountain TV

quiet now
everyone talking
about the thunderstorm

some of the light underwater
in a white stone

of spiders
rock formations
someone in the wind
with a fantasy

a screen door opens
and closes itself

the cool wind
as wide as holes
curved
blue side of the rock
of cool winds
warm wind
children's voices
melt in the night
a quiet bay
with seaweed and rocks
the sun at rest
a forest walk
ending at the beach

in the tracks

on the beach
foam fans
beach fire
flowing into waves

inviting rocks by the pond
to dance on water
green round pond
lily pads of late summer
mossy pennies
summer departs
the stagnant pond
stays right here
alone in the storm
anchored to a rocky reef
clang of a buoy bell
narrow river
opening just a crack
the wide ocean
white with foam
the ocean enters
the river's mouth
reservoir
an ancient river
refilled
river days
a stream of light
flows by
river mouth
bridged
by gulls
redwood roots
the river's course
bends and twists
deep below
running in the sea
other rivers
rushing river
brushes the air
with white ripples
walking the mountains
the river goes along
with us
mid-morning
the river refreshes itself
with a little breeze
the earth turns
now and then
the river bends
hot sun presses
water into a river
summer flood
from the river
winding up the river
a stream of cool air
sleeping
valley river sounds
dream
sleeping
below the noisy river
the other one
stopping by the river
sunlight
a bank of fog
rocky stream
a dropped feather
dyes it blue
dry riverbed
covered in the mornings
with puffy clouds
resting
the river
in its bed
streambed
bent to fit the earth
a fallen willow
face to face
with ancient rocks
the tourist touches hers
sea spray
a rock drawn in the air
its water shape
mountain boulders
breaking up
the light
desert rocks
listening to the music
of water
monoliths
holding the rosy sun
against blue night
broken rock
half hot
half cold
rocks
legends
in sand
rocks
leaving clearly
sand
rocks
in veins of ore
roots
magnetic
lines in the rock
writing it down
evening reflected
by glowing granite
lighted from within
rocks
at the foot of the bed
waves splash
water falls
on Japanese landscapes
sea rocks
a crack
in the monolith
one star
the top of the rock
in the bottom of the pool
bright with sun
cracking a smile
faces in sandstone
slanted sun
splashing each other
centuries in the surf
brother rocks
after the rain
all the desert colors
in wet rocks
red rock walls
echo
blue rock walls
forces of nature
a sense of theater
with rocks
mountain peak
stars burned into rocks
glitter all day
high tide
lapping the fire
in a rock
road to the moon
between ash meadows
salt ponds
reflected
on the moon
salt flats
Death Valley
salts a bright blue lake
at twilight
earth fissures
lacing the pond
dried salt
the line
between water and hills
a salt sea
desert beach
green moss white
with salts
lining the hills
edges of the sea
with salt
rolling over
into dry sand
the 7th wave
snow-capped peaks
then the wave spreads
over a sandy beach
dark and growling
from land a summer storm
becomes a glass sea
lying low
before storm clouds
a smooth sea
distant horizon
sea miles marked
by different colors
water drawing
a straight line between
sea and sky
splashes
return to the sea
a dance
sea stacks
the white smoke
of spindrift
two crows land
with sun on their backs
sky country
undercurrents
below spindrift
a mellow flute
spindrift
above the ocean wave
a prayer flag
spindrift
a cloud hangs
where a wave broke
night fall
yet not one stone
moves
painting stones
a mountain brook moving
tree shadows
alluvial fans
the valley heat
on stone fields
shimmering
above the hot stones
summer sea
one stone
climbing the mountain
in my shoe
covered with stones
the stream makes a path
to the river
fire in the mist
rushing down the highway
far mountains
mountain path
the roundness of the earth
arches between my feet
poem maps
under summer feet
paths
midnight car
lining the coast
with highway one
headlights
on a rain-drenched pass
slanted sunlight
yellow line
on a black highway
last sun rays
desert highway
the poet writes a haiku
on the yellow line
mountains
twisting roads
in us
following the river
following the sun
through mountains
rivers
building roads
in mountains
desert paths
the smell of water
paving the way
without moving
our road goes from town to town
changing its name
a summer shower
the asphalt road
rising in steam
beach road
summer smooth
from sandy feet
a mountain
bends in the road
heaped high
mountain road
going and going and yet
time stands still
freeway
a truckload of art
passing tanks
dust
the road disappears
in itself
road
winding around the mountain
mountain views
down from the pass
still the black road
wiggles
in the stream
waiting for wind ripples
to move the mountain
this beach stream
hangs our sandals on two fingers
runs to the sea
an open window
surf sounds
square
night surf
the bright waves
of flame
surf's boom
sun beats into water
sound on metal
earth spins
surf sounds
in dry sand
boiling seas
into a wild surf
a hot sun
black cypress
draining into the swamp
strands of color
home again
a pulse of tides
in our blood
tilted
this side of the ocean
dries in the sun
dry rocks
bubbling up between
the incoming tide
incoming tide
the sun-dried rock
wetted
rattle of rocks
at high tide the stars
an earthly tone
night tide
black rocks blacker
as a dark moon
freshly washed hair
receding tide leaves
wet rocks
high and low
tides weaving
sand
the tide turns
a whoosh of wave
splashes white
pictures
in the burning wood
tide lines
rippling light
night tide flows back
to a sunlit sea
high tide
sharing a small beach
with wet feet
melting
in a tide pool
sun on still waters
deep in the earth
tremors in our knees
magnified
after tremors
in the fear and trembling
frog voices
rocks
crumble into valleys
evening colors
deepening
the lowest point in USA
night shadow
jagged mountains
the wide slope of valley
smoothes the air
mountain shadows
tracing valley contours
across the sky
layers of color
the cliff eases into valleys
blue dusk
San Joaquin valley:
sand walking valley
after all my years
Queen Valley*
mother earth
full of gold
empty night sky
fills the desert valley
with city lights
the breaking wave
cough drop colored
cool mint
between rainclouds
sunlight slants
deep into valleys
mountain greatness
the gentle easing
into valleys
rainclouds
blowing into the valley
sunset's golden light
bell tones
of the country side
village names
evenings
setting the sky on fire
lava mountains
red into black
summit passes
into sunset
mid-day
heat of volcanoes
still in the rocks
lava rocks flowing
with the river
night-long shadows
lava rocks
flowing with the river
dry summer heat
black lava
pushing into bloodred
sunset peaks
sunshine
the tops of waves melting
into hard metal
sun in front
of each crested wave
its own radiance
night air
breathing deeply the waves
wet dry sand
walls of water
waves in rock
a tearing sound
waves crash
in the curve of the bay
unbroken by man
wave upon wave
sun beats the water
into a hard curve
earth turning
a wave rounds
the blue green
elephant rock
stomping on the beach
ocean waves
asleep
yet waves remember
to come ashore
a wave breaks
out in laughter
two people
waves
unrolling
seafoam
mounting up
a wave rides a rock
ashore
rolling in waves
the white foam clouds
thunder
solid waves
flowing into the surf
dunes
arching into the sky
the wave takes on
more blue
teary eyes
seeing with binoculars
salt waves
white laced waves
tearing silk
across the sand
each wave curves upward
catches a gleam of sunlight
then moves on
seas of silk
shapes without scissors
waves torn asunder
waves
feeling
time
a woman
a step down
a waterfall
taking to the waterfall
the everyday worries
washed away
mountain waterfall
fog flows backwards
into clouds
breath of angels
air of waterfalls
up one's nose
foot of the falls
tourists stopped
in their tracks
foot of the falls
the roaring opens
tourists' mouths
writing its name
on a granite cliff
water falls
quiet river
all of the wind
out of its falls
water drops
a radiance
in the falls
beyond the campfire
darkness draws together
the woods at night
airport
up in the smoke
faces I've met there
waiting area
mom and dad's faces
grounded
airport carpeting
the dizziness
above and below
before boarding
a finger on the wingtip
cold and sweaty
among strangers
sun rises without a night
flares on metal wings
barefoot
her sweat socks
still do
smooth sand
chasing children down the beach
their foot prints
watered silk
bright surf catches
her pants leg
a huge wave
rolling up her pants
still wet
missing the malls
on the ocean beach
she gathers shells
the fat child
gathers the most sea shells
pockets bulging
high tide
the beach leaves a mark
in her book
afternoon wind
all the beachcomber's words
blown out to sea
heat wave
on the beach crowds
cool fog
cold beach walk
on sun-warmed car seats
two sweatshirts
curls of waves
yet on the beach all day
her hair goes straight
smuggler's cove
stones wash on the beach
the size of skulls
a special beach
I put a pebble in my mouth
before leaving
car doors slam
essence of starfish comes
home with us
beachcomber
gift of civilization
a hairbrush
beach bums
at a sermon of gulls
one tries to sleep
smelling the light
on her tanned shoulder
home from the beach
cyclist
picking up a nail
from a crosswalk
flat country lane
a man on a bike
slices the sky
tourists
too tipsy to drive
out in a canoe
choppy waves
the small boat between
two worlds
behind the speedboat
water bent and broken
mends with ripples
streaked with gold
sunset in the rich folks' harbor
the tallest mast
in a canoe
a man eating a banana
peeled
a summer day
drifting by
in a canoe
river's bend
wave lengths of setting sun
broken by a canoe
rowing on the lake
boats filled
with empty sounds
stopped down
by the river's pace
drifting boats
studying waves
he drifts off
to sleep
cabin closed
the waiting in the woods
as we come
the tiny cabin
listening to pine wind
its very own planks
early summer
cabin walls leaking
late night cold
back again
in the summer cabin
winter dreams
tin roof
hearing the edge of a cloud
wet with rain
warm dry air
the river low in August
a door opening
leaving for home
summer cabin floors
swept bare
camping
man's first home
a wall of green wind
pillared by pine
driftwood logs
slanted sunlight
a driftwood shack
remembering other times
places
fights forgotten
neighbor kids building
a club house
the open window
screened with a web
leaf shadows
remaking the bed
the river flows by
the campground
nearly awake
sea-gathered light
on sleeping faces
environmentally sound
wiping the new-age camper
with recycled paper
summertime
the way to the circus
childish voices
carousel
the sun goes around
up and down
Berkeley sidewalks
the rest of my education
on the street
selling peace buttons
he buys the mulatto a coffee
room for the night
street woman
her tits at home
in T-shirts
city park
hands of the blind
sparrows
home from haying
the weight of a wooden rake
on sun burnt shoulders
a giving sound
wheat leans into
the mowing machine
it is still hot
tractors coming home
with headlights
sound of a fan
blowing a cool hole
back into summer
paper and sticks
the coolness of a ocean
painted on a fan
dry wind
the smell of smoke
bright red
hot moon
marked and spotted gray
by forest fires
plowing a firebreak
the dry earth
a cloud of smoke
clearing a trail
it only seems clean
after a shower
fruitstand
the girl-watcher pinches
a peach
your long letter
a garden around me
tall white summer skies
gardens
voices among flowers
patterned paths
evening song
the scythe set a stone
leans on the fence
snapping beans
she doesn't look up
when the gate slams
garden spider
at home in a hat
dangles at my ear
a new hoe
chopping the grasses
of last spring
cabbage gardener
seeing white butterflies
in a new light
long walk home
the incoming tide
refills footprints
hot stones
footprints of swimmers
going home
homeward bound
our days of vacation
in brown skin
driving in time
rivers flow backwards
as we leave the sea
going home
down the mountain road
sunset
leaving
the ocean waves
come back
tracks on the beach
all the feet have returned
to the city
welcome home
the far ridge filled
with thunder
coming home
to the rest of rain
all day long
the way home
a scent of open fires
clinging to my wrist
the weight of eyelids
home from the beach
full of sand
home again
a bath and the towel
with a blue border
hikers rest
at the waterfall
coming down to earth
heavy sweating
the taste of mountain
on a hot day
squeaky knee joints
canyon river sounds
coming up the hill
canyon springs
where water rest in light
travelers pause
going down the mountain
its rocky river words
still in our ears
tired bones
back-packed in
a mountain hike
the back of my hand
he said
and we were lost
looking down
the tops of trees
rooted in the canyon
hitch hiker
leaving the no-camping area
his pack all lumpy
one path
heel to toe
and warm
mountain climbers
their voices higher
than the rocks
climbers
effortless the assent
of their voices
soft pink hills
the hiker invited to rest
way over there
in the valley
stretched to the setting sun
soles of hiker's feet
hikers resting
yet the mountain moves
its morning shadow
humming
"Pomp and Circumstances"
mountain hikers
mountain hikers
morning as wide
as spirit shapes
Sierra hike
taking John Muir's word
home again
hitch-hiker
on the picnic basket
several small bugs
hitch hikers
a car full of flies
going to LA
sun on her knee
stuck on raspberry jam
dripping through toast
August beaches
for moms and crabs
the nitty-gritty
teenagers
tumbling on the sands
over-playful waves
afternoon quiet
the grandson's crayon
melts on the porch
evening clouds
stretched low on the horizon
a child's name being called
on her breast
brightness next to shadow
of lace
ocean foam
all night the loveliness
of a lace gown
laundry day
the gardenia blooms
clear white
billowing white
filled with a summer day
clouds on a clothesline
laundry dries
a change of sea wind
dampens it again
bottom of the basket
the sandy beaches
of dirty clothes
home again
the mountain that remains
laundry
land's end
the low star turns
into a lighthouse
the lighthouse
mirrors over the sea
a yellow pyramid
two lollipops
wrapped in cellophane
matching sisters
a noon nap
rock shadows
restless
picking up sleep
where you left it at dawn
afternoon nap
roadside rest stop
getting out of the car
all the tiredness
not really tired
a summer day
lays down to rest
beach sand
measuring a poet
stretched out
waking
shadows from a nap
have moved
slick rock faces
climbers' strain
against the rope
dots of shadow
climbing the mountain
flute notes on both sides
to the summit
to view the lowest point
in the valley
ridge dark
in town
a good movie
outdoor movies
around the old films
moths
after the show
the smell of rain
on hot asphalt
summer afternoon
the coolness of white
naked on a quilt
moss-green bank
the woman reclining nude
as is the river
nude beach
nothing new
under the sun
naked
on the porch
passion flowers
newborn
swimming in the river nude
on your birthday
on the nude beach
from her tits to her toes
it's Saturday night
outdoor flute concert
the second movement
the wind
singing low
sea-white fog disappears
in an outdoor concert
following strings
stars hum along
with the guitar
harpsichord
tightened spinal cords
jangle
hot summer night
all that jazz
shared by neighbors
going insane
radio rock
a block away
stop light
music from other cars
perfume
in her hands
coming out of the hills
clay pots
beach clay
in her hands palm prints
a vase for flowers
how quiet
the cove where divers left
their trash
dune buggies
in the desert night
electric fireflies
dune buggies
nights in valley lights
parked
inspiring view
eating cereal
with a pencil
row upon row
torn from a notebook
mountain lines
sea painting
a child's water color box
full of sand
watercolor paper
stopping a wave
with a brush
sunlight
trying to paint highlights
on tops of waves
waves
following the brush
into a watercolor
watercolor class
the beach giving lessons
in making waves
a Sunday painter
the lighthouse just as big
as a gnarled thumb
dried up
in a box of paints
summer sea colors
a hummed tune
painting a wave
realistic
in exchange
for a special rock
flute notes
a gentle breeze
river willows not moving
lost fishing lines
looking up
from the crime story
passion flowers
as everyone knew
poets who write by the sea
are all wet
empty
desert notebook
fills with sand
the book closed
yet hearing the poems
thunderstorm
green faded ribbon
the English lute
hangs songs on a nail
sounds of a harp
drifting into the forest
into birdsong
in rows
bees and his lips
at harmonica holes
tuning the dulcimer
legs of a spider
crawling out
country market
the humane society sponsors
a flea market
alone
the world stops
just to find it
raspberry jam
on a peanut butter sandwich
high noon lips
weathered picnic tables
after the summer shower
mustard stains wet
ocean view
tourists taking photos
leaving trash
tourists
taken by the view
snapshots
curved
on the ground lens
a wind-swept pine
sunset
when the show's the best
the lights go out
canyon rim photo
after the click he sees
his toes in space
loaded with cameras
donkeys with a master's degree
in photography
worn smooth
the wind-swept cedar
everyone photographs
in the desert
a sudden whirring
camera's automatic rewind
crumpled
silver sunshine
on a photo
summer afternoon
filling the pool
with neighbor's kids
at the gynecologist
knitting a baby blanket
for the seventh grandchild
restless waves
tourists
newly arrived
restless sea
houses of folks
taking it easy
night rocks
in beach fog
drunken voices
newcomers
digging their toes in sand
cliffs of California
playing my flute
Indians
ten thousand years ago
aborigines
my mind still fits
the grinding place
desert
bare bones
living
watering the desert
a small yellow stream
between her feet
uphill
a load of firewood heats
wheelbarrow handles
mountain lights
the glow of candles
in jelly glasses
rusty pump
cussing and swearing
it goes again
campfire
cooking clouds
in oyster stew
outdoor plumbing
showering with stars
sandy soap
outdoor shower
in a path of moonlight
surf sounds
outdoor tub
bathing in the scent of pine
still on the trees
city girl
how to brush her teeth
with a wet finger
in the tub
heat of the day
goes down the drain
squatting over earth
just as I pee
thunder
drought
the scorched earth
where he always pees
sleeping on the floor
an Indian rug curls up
beside me
wakeful hours
bending a square of moonlight
a rag rug
dried prune faces
guests when they hear
we have only a privy
stern child
on the wall behind the hippie
her baby picture
all day outlines
dust on her sandals
where toes were
hot weather
wearing the day
all night
summer moon
patterns on the porch
a crazy quilt
summer evening
the porch swing moves
a new moon
high tide
waves breaking loud
around my pillow
night bushes
the candle's flame
red in animal eyes
lost
in the night stars changing
the summer sky
a canopy bed
covered with summer stars
airy blankets
mountain winds
sleeping all night
with open mouths
asleep
light from the sea
in her face
dawn
stars turning into
mosquitoes
waking up
the itch of bug bites
brand new
Grand Canyon
a hole in the ground
filled with mountains
Point Arena lighthouse
snags the morning sun
and $3.00 each
unfenced precipice
he remembers as unpaid
life insurance
Japanese journey
Sacramento rice fields
and Mount Lassen
stars
carried into caves
tourists' candles
Indian cave:
songs still
wind
cave dwellers
the grinding stone
hollow
bringing home
memories
of Indian caves
caution:
in the petrified forest
no smoking signs
harbor town bells
on Saturday night
buoys
rock woman
facing into desert sun
her sky-blue eye
Holland
flattened against the sky
warmed at the edges
Salton sea
its blue also covers
the far hills
on every road
canals with drawbridges
for pictures
country villages
the sloped roofs huddle
against green growing
before their doorways
in the hour before darkness
people as statues
in the museum
yellow flowers floating
a glass paperweight
seeing my face
in the crowd I bought
the mirror
naked breasts
wearing only the dark lace
shadows of her straw hat
her straw hat
asleep by the garden
of noon-day sun
eyes closed
only my breast to view
the sea
off-shore breeze
coming to land
on bikini bodies
cooling the sand
the fat lady's shadow
on a hot day
evening deepens
the tan on her legs
with varicose veins
grains of sand
days of a life
lying on a beach
silence
to seek and wrap around
the body nothing
tanned
except for the places
a fly sits
bodies
given to the desert
sun
hot bathed body
dried by desert
stars
sun-bathing
conservationists
saving water
evenings
drawing closer to the fire
sun-burnt faces
green waves
florescent with surfers
in mod wetsuits
sleeping in the sun
only surfer dreams
ride the bright waves
surfers
black suited
among seals
rationed water
in the desert
our wet places
bright blue armpits
the indigo blouse fades
into a hot day
beach day
evening turning
flesh to fire
lumbago's dull pain
a summer breeze frisks
by the bed
feverish
on a hot day defrosting
the refrigerator
summer colds
the neighbor's dog barks
when we cough
on one hand
the liver spots of aging
poison ivy
churning seas
love-making
in the hot tub
making love
into hot tub foam
falling stars
an undriven nail
caught in the lighthouse
at land's end
between our legs
dancing flames
in a fire place
log to ashes
clocks
our love-making
after the tryst
the red candle gutted
yet  comes sunrise
ocean waves pound
the tattoo on his arm
blue skin
the rocky river
our knees a buzz
with the current
swimmers
afternoon heat
underwater
salt crystal ripples
washing shells on my feet
toenails
sitting in the river
rhythmic waves between my legs
does it for me
taking heat
down from the ridge
into the river
hills and valleys
a woman lying flat
in the river
an old woman
swimming the August stream
the mossy smell
catching the big one
a fat old lady hauls out
on the nude beach
swimming alone
the drag of undertow
mom calls
tea house
fresh air fills the cup
with green tree
date groves
palms waving
at single tourists
bound by a bell
strangers in the street
of ancient churches
good for the tongue
names of Norwegian
home-cooked food
sidewalks of Paris
the smell of coffee
on a foreign tongue
nasal tones
long bread under dark blue
elbows
tourists at sunset
in canyon walls
a sea of red eyes
closed in sleep
all the eyes
seeing the canyon
tourists
still keeping alive
ghost towns
dry river bed
round rocks moving
into tourist's cars
airport parking lot
bubble gum sticking to me
my home town
going home
car doors close
out the river
going down the road
rocky river rhythms
in our legs
lost
eyes on the map
miss the turn
mid-morning hunger
driving right past
the chocolate hills
a sign
at the fork in the road
freeways
car motors
cursing
granite boulders
rolling along the roads
tiny tin cars
driving home
the wrecked car
still there
a trip
with maiden aunts
coming apart
after traveling
the hot tub filled
with strangers
sea side darkness
leaving the city bright
not-knowing
dancing in bed
next to the nightclub
motel sleeplessness
Grand Canyon
so very huge
no room in the inn
desert vacation
the first day back
into a mountain stream
stars
in the hot tub
two on vacation
for rent
on the door
magic runes
rented windows
190' of ocean view
on Mastercharge
window to window
oceanside vacationers
eyeball to eyeball
roadside bench
everyone drives
right on by
sea escape
the cliff house hangs
out in space
between
two views of the sea
a color TV
six o'clock news
we turn to watch the world
of a picture window
my bare legs
on the stranger
legs of chairs
shutting the door
not shutting out
surf sounds
a cup of coffee
the cruise ship steams
into another window
by the window
a fireplace joins
the lighthouse
vacation
the first day
without rain
seaside summer
hearing the foghorn
then nothing else
vacation house
sitting on the porch
gift wrapped
Indian cave
shadows deep in cracks
from other suns
pepper trees
hot as hell
at the mission
circling the mission
a flutter of wings
just pigeons?
jet age
still in the ancient mission
an offering of fire
church yard
colors of fallen stones
raised by flowers
mission church
a roof of song in rows
of starlings
at the shrine
pine needles crisscross
the holy spot
holy place
sitting on sacred rocks
itches
guests
the only ones on time
are the stars
sun through fog
visiting children blow
soap bubbles
kids discover
spooky white in beach sand
grandma's ankles
child finally sleeps
stars come out singing
a lullaby
sign
palm reader
open
Gypsy lips
curve into a smile
future revealed
all during supper
the city boy sits
on the tractor
how he inspects his fields
the man with visitors
from his wife's family
visiting
how good to see her oven
dirtier than mine
sun cookies
the kids ate them all up
before the eclipse
company
serving zucchini bread
repeatedly
his relatives
serving zucchini bread
disguised as special
visiting relatives
the narrow bed holds
us together
an old album
in the granddaughter's lap
rose petals
summer guests
taking it with them
back to town
deserted road
first the tourists leave
and now the geese
three lizards
together on the mountaintop
- and we talked
creaking with the weight
the noon-day sun heavy
in wicker chairs
new cushions
on the lawn chairs
thick moonlight
wind
moonlight in wind chimes
still
in the zoo
tiger lilies
growing wild
a wild lion
caged in his eyes
small children
children's eyes
in the snow leopard's cage
touching his spots
raisins
in the oatmeal
ants
heat
creeping over sand dunes
fire ants
cool desert shade
moving across hot sands
fire-biting ants
a stream of tourists
meeting in the desert
ants
a line of ants lead
to the body
beginning to crumble
bone white
ants carrying away
the darkness
stars
carried into caves
bat eyes
adding ribs
to the colors of midnight
a bat
unfolding wings
an up-canyon wind
a bright bird
surf rolls
power in the sand
low-flying birds
going home
birds across the lake
in nests
bird tracks
for each line of dust
a short life poem
a house in the woods
my cage for me
to live among birds
birds fly on
stepping stones of a still pond
cloud to cloud
landing
a wing spread with light
folds into feathers
what is a branch
and what is a bird leg?
the answer flies away
desert sound
in the bird's open beak
only the wind
mountain meadow
bird call arcs to call
in answers
dawn
desert silence an oasis
of bird song
desert morning
bubbles in the hot spring
bird song
breakfast
campfire coffee cups
of bird song
one bird calls
the not-yet sun
in barren rocks
desert birds
music in their beaks
running water
going to sleep
songs of birds
growing dark
night
call of a bird
without color
summer sky
in and out of the nest
bluebirds
growing up male
color flows into his wings
baby bluebird
between pines
the summer sky sings
bluebird songs
branches bend
a streak of feather
sky blue
sprinkled breast babies
with cinnamon shoulders
rare bluebirds
picnic
a babbling brook
of blue jays
nap time
blue jays, too
blissfully quiet
up with the birds
country living with families
of blue jays
winding up
the blue jay alarm clock
early sunrise
May morning
electric with the hum
hatching bugs
yellow bugs on the lettuce
squished
are yellow inside also
these bugs!
yesterday I squashed
those bugs
clapping
praise without hands
a butterfly
fluttering
the butterfly has no time
for a name
eyelash
curves a glance
teases a butterfly
a flower lifted
from the stem floats
a butterfly
even while resting
butterflies go on dreaming
of flight
waiting at the corner
only a butterfly
and this lovely girl
walking
with a butterfly
here I too pause
end of summer
following it out of sight
a butterfly
before the hot sun
white on the butterfly's wing
melted transparent
a face among the flowers
then the butterfly
folds its wings
butterfly colors
the air woven
with healing
a broken crayon
the path of a butterfly
drawn by a child
high fashion
butterflies decorate
my garden hat
a yellow cat
melting in the August sun
summer days
the cat's milk
swimming with ants
hot in August
summer's heat
caged in the stripes
of a ginger kitty
to and fro
in a hammock
a cat purrs
buzz of cicadas
pushing quicksilver
up the thermometer
a shrill cry
overheated the cicada peels
out of its skin
soft morning air
the quiet afterbirth
of the cicada
a show
for the price of peanuts
three chipmunks
buoy bells
from rock shadows
cormorants
sea meadows
as rocks and cows
rocks and cows
sunset
the great bull closes
both eyes
cooling cows
the tree extends its shadow
over a yellow one
by the bullpen
a fence has torn off
a red shirt
hearing the cuckoo
calling out for a lover
morning seems so young
dog days
hoping the stray pup
comes back
backyard circus
for the price of a penny
the neighbor's dog barks
morning fog
the calling of doves
many small circles
cooing doves
lengthening the coolness
of shade trees
a hollowness
waiting for the dove
to call again
doves
lingering by the dark door
feather light
swing still
the rope squeak
of a dove
mountain climbers
resting in an eerie
eaglets
mountain peak
an eagle leaves it
moonlight
sea cliff home
nestled by cypress
house finches
our kisses
on our legs
fish kisses
salmon fingerlings
swimming by the nude beach
eyes bulging
jumping in
a river of fingerlings
our bodies too pale
lightning
fireflies above puddles
peek at themselves
on my ankles
the cat ignores the bites
of her fleas
a little clumsy
the scrub jay teaches
fledglings to fly
company is coming
even the flies buzz
at the door
drone of flies
curved as desert sand
around noon
before one's very eyes
heatwaves shimmering
flies
if only flies would nap
among the cats and books
on wicker chairs
surf rolls
life in the sand
beach flies
fly wings
fanning summer
hotter
helping him out
the fly is crushed
against the door
tucked in bed
warm summer days
of goose down
sand dunes
drying the wings
of each gnat
shadowed river
transparent wings of gnats
the only light
desert pond
in the national park
goldfish
passing summer
as shadow nears the pond
koi quickly hide
summer passing
the ripple on the koi pond
an orange fin
here grasshopper
at pepper plant restaurant
aphids!
breaking waves
the screams of gulls
soft sand
skimming waves
spindrift feathers
a gull
along the cliff
wing tips of gulls
at eye level
high tide mark
gulls search
another time
before us
the road flown
by two sea gulls
gull wings
lifting the light
from the sea
gulls
playing with the wind
their shadows
blue white
swirls in evening skies
gulls
cutting up
a cove's high seas
the soaring gull
sea birds home
on shores of booming surf
the unused songs
Sunday beach
a sermon of sea gulls
one goes wading
mountain overlook
twinkling above the sea
a flock of gulls
sea gulls
over land and water
smoke from fire
tearing together
fish entrails
gulls' laugh
on rocks
the first sunshine
a gull
lunchtime
overlooking the road ahead
a hawk
fog billows
the gray streaks
of a hornet's nest
end of summer
walking the riverbank
just a heron
a flutter of flowers
hovering in the heat
hummingbirds
roof newly shingled
nestled under pine cones
lady bugs
surprising
tourists on the beach
meadow larks
above wild flowers
the song of the lark widens
the meadow higher
flowers songs
while looking out to sea
meadow larks
stones
a patterned shadow moves
on lizard legs
a hot wind
secrets of dunes
from a lizard
a patch blue sky
the belly of a lizard
filled with flies
flying water
into desert lizards
gnats
wind echo
in round rocks
lizard eyes
eyes
painted on cave walls
lizards
ancient eyes
on cave walls
lizards
lizard eyes
a summer cooled
by the glint
a dry scrape
as the door slams
lizards run
summer
a brown twig becomes
a lizard
salt cedars
gray moving to touch
lizard skin
heat exchange
in a sudden breeze
two lizards
giant boulders
the lizards arrive late
for the flute concert
mayflies
a pair of birds
playing catch
heart pounding
the tiny animals that scurry
within the earth
added to stars
 swarm of mosquitoes
obscure the view
the sting
of a summer alarm clock
mosquitoes
late letter
worded with mosquito bodies
my blood
summer melting
mosquitoes' sound
in a harmonica
drowned mosquito
it's dangerous to swim
in my navel
swatting mosquitoes
how lightly goes a life
at sunset
dead mosquito
no longer interested
in biting me
braiding in her hair
last night's dream
a tiny moth
Gypsy circus
in the tent
moths
against my cheek
a touch of powder
moth wing
fog thickening
into the lamp beam
a moth
a garden lantern
attracting a few moths
and all the stars
silver gray words
a quiver of moth wings
in hard green eyes
nights
a moth at the window
star-crazy
up under the roof
between our legs small birds
fly into nests
osprey
silver between his talons
spindrift fish
spreading his tail
corn flung in the flight-fan
draws the peacock
wave to wave
pelicans follow flashes
of lightning
pelicans
clowning tops
of waves
among cholla
cactus soft
on the cottontail
soft-eyed seal
watching a lone man
and his daughter
wave within a wave
riding one a seal
his heart pumping
curve of waves
leaping seals thicken
translucent waves
barking seals
their breath comes to the mainland
as mist
waiting for rain
the slow way slugs
make love
winding creek
the snake's tongue
forked
in a trail
of man shade shadow
snake shadow
desert road
snaking through
low hills
sidewinder
getting us off the trail
without a step
a jog
in the trail
a sidewinder
unwinding a cobra
a ring of round notes
from the flute
curved rocks
looped in the trail
a sidewinder
rocky river
in its sound a rattle
snake
rattlesnake
coiled into a spring
of rust
flute concert
for the finale
a rattlesnake claps
downtown Point Arena
from trash bin to weed patch
a snake
on snake lips
two kicking frog legs
a snakey smile
arched over
the skunk's back
stripes of moonlight
spines
in the desert
tarantula legs
paths
crisscrossed by appetites
of spiders
wind yo-yo
up and down a silken thread
breeze-riding spider
a wobbly line
of black writing
a spider walks by
the spider crawls
two legs to the left
then three forward
plaid bedspread

strumming the dulcimer
misses a spider
over the mirror
in the angel's white eye

calling the flowers by name
each nods
flower shapes
in dried mud
blooming
desert flowers
their colors too
are hot today
flowers by the door
nameless except for the color
of these blue days

its papery leaves
the meadow mowed

ravens in the grain
bales of straw
without cow curves
lying in the meadow

above their roots the seeds
nearly touching
sheaves of grass
water that does not break
flows in ripples

of moss
up and down
on pillows of moss

just inhaling deeply
feels like stealing
rose breeze
leaves of a bush
shiver white

in his lap
