cinders
forgotten
thoughts
lava hills
ashes sparsely covered
with ghost weeds
lava pumice
the part-time cook
recognizes something
canyon walls
curved enough for clouds'
shadows to climb
desolate canyon
with only one note
a bird calls
desolate canyon
the apple rotten
at the core
canyon rim rocks
dwarf pines cling
with every root
canyon rim
something in me flies
over precipices
canyon rim walls
the sound of zippers
going up down jackets
canyon silence
skims the wind
a roar at the rim
music box canyon
wind in the dry river
like water running
canyon ledges
stones return the music
to wind
cemetery wind
sounds in the shells
of one's ears
all of their possession
side by side
cemetery plots
out of the cemetery
the first laugh
a cold wind
thunder
knees on graveyard earth
tremble
their eyes closed
to a million dollar view
a seaside cemetery
crossroads cemetery
the old man asks
the way home
buried here
autumn woods are full
of ancestors
riverside cemetery
late in autumn
chilled waters still
leaving the cemetery
sunrise
on frost-cracked soil
burial ground
naked trees veil
the sunrise
walking the land
that has taken my parents
their years
wheels of the hearse
packing the powdery snow
into useless patterns
swirling white clouds
on the desert floor
dust devils
neighbors
on the road in litigation
dust devils
crater winds
blowing back in
a thousand years
crater
where the earth exploded
a couple argue
photographing
the graves
without film
church bells
a spade cuts through
stony ground
open grave
frosted air penetrates
deep into earth
tending the graves
the dirt under my nails
is just a beginning
childless
standing beside a mother
at a child's grave
out of the grave
the sinking casket
pushes the light
a frosty night
gravestones rise
the width of a crack
hole in the silence
grave diggers alone
lower the coffin
between the graves
fences between friends
falling apart
visiting graves
the stone at dusk
warms
visiting graves
stone gardens lengthen
autumn's cool
his grave
filled with
his earth
his grave
covered with
my sky
rain
covering his grave
with low clouds
juicy blackberries
under the tangled vines
a forgotten grave
after visiting graves
a night of fever-chills
their nightmares
late afternoon
afraid to take nap
while visiting graves
last daughter
selling his house
setting a stone
"gone but not forgotten"
the white obelisk
in a patch of weeds
forgetting where
the family stone
sinks in
tombstones
marking those things
that don't die
deserted beach
alone with the waves
of September
October beach
in all the footprints
the tread of shoes
autumn blooms
soft white cotton balls
a harvest field
brown harvest field
the balls of white cotton
polka dots
maple hills
stain the evening sky
autumn
barren hills
yet patches of purple
shadow
steps to the cabin
where you once lived
low in broken grass
selling the house
the scratch of a pen
in the family name
a chain of old keys
in a closed house
unlocking memories
the deed signed
taking down the birdhouse
dad built
bodies buried
and now the house belongs
to someone else
village lights
stretch down the road
draw us home
the afternoon sun
slants over a hand-made house
paints it September
selling the house
one last swim in the lake
the water's calm
flying home
at 35,000 feet my folks
are not here either
nights the dripping roof
walks alone around the house
on one leg
hot springs
cool in the river
a jasper stone
desert storm
at the resort
hot springs
mineral baths
at night the many colors
in dreams
Death Valley
the underground river
a healing spring
moonlight
around the hot springs
dried salt
in healing waters
stars
old bodies
soul bathing
in hot springs
desert stars
Ley lines
lines
drawn into the earth
earth lines
converging
flute tones
walking
the line within
the mountain
a moonlit meadow
all the nun are dressed up
as clowns
a moonlit meadow
chanting women give a voice
to dark ages
sea meadow ridge
the broken fence moves
when the cows come home
heather moors
rolled r's of wind
between the boulders
patchwork quilt
the rumpled beds
of heather
clouds of fog
hovering over stems
white heather
voices winding
through the heather moor
patterned paths
Death Valley
in a bluish haze
spectral mountains
mountain peaks
folding in prayer
for centuries
desert basin
mountains washed
down flat
light
leaving in the mountains
a distance
salt patterns
mountain shapes
blue twilight
even mountains
gentle easing into earth
Death Valley
alkali clouds
over lava mountains
moonrise
wind mountain
inverted in the crater
invisible
movement of a bush
an animal the wind
of mountains moving
white clouds
bury the mountains
in deepest black
mountains between us
holding back the dawn
hours of my longing
mountain caves
wind carving empty
eye sockets
bodies
on Indian ritual ground
wrecked cars
where Indians died
the carcasses of ponies
of old cars
Indian rocks
the night hawk's spirit
with a whir of wings
pages torn
from a sketchbook
far mountain ridges
autumn river
covering my feet wet
with golden leaves
quiet eddy pools
swirl at ankles in autumn
the ancient dead
in this light
flowing through the ages
desert river
fall
rocks tumble down
a dry river bed
white water
well-washed river
spirits
white ghost waves
rocky river ripples
roll upstream
wind rushing
into the valley
rockwater
the top of the rock
in the bottom of the pool
another stone
winding river road
the giant forest
approaches night
atop the mountain
mammoth rocks stare down
a smooth gray sea
bright sun
on the long waves of autumn
end of a day
night
the horizon sinks into the blue
water
stones
in the desert landscape
my bones
ascending alone
the threshold to heaven
barren rock
dry riverbed
in one of its rocks
dreamless sleep
monoliths
shaping the moonlight
granite
moon bright
where a rock fell away
shining
strangers
on the city side walks
one has his laugh
lamplight
straightening the street
of narrow houses
approaching the temple
grasses rub the body
of a snake
logging road
cut trees that never come
to the temple
before the temple
lizards turn
the grass brown
climbing temple hill
leg muscles tighten
in our throats
breathless
atop the steep hill
temple pagoda
breathless
climbing to the pagoda
wind
sea winds blow
from temple copper domes
holy sunshine
Tibetan temple
the high-pitched hum
of an air plane
to our round eyes
temple splendors
a locked gate
temple secrets
held together
a chain link fence
temple fence
red and yellow prayer flags
poison ivy
holy smells
free in the air
between fences
temple dump
finding something
we could see
Sunday
morning light from high rocks
temples
curving
the sky dome
temple roof
making temples
a full moon
on ash mountains
timberline
granite rocks outgrowing
the trees
red rock waterfall
into emerald pools
cedar incense
water blackened rocks
falling with the waterfall
some of them
chipped rock
the shape of water
falling
white rim 
on black rock light falling
with the water
old forest
on bare paths
moths
night shadows
the valley floor rises
into the sky
tired
valley slopes
sag
the earth turns
in the valley
a river bends
Death Valley
saving light at dusk
salt
Death Valley
open blue skies
clouded
pale fog
yellow vineyards over
champagne cellars
wine-tasting
at the family-run vineyard
a cat too
late afternoon
water leaking out
of the cove
afternoon nap
a visit with angels
how you snore
between fingers
the empty air
of afternoon
cricket silence
between scraping sounds
autumn begins
the sky
because it is that old
that blue
October's
bright blue weather
out to sea
blue sky
coming into the tree's shadow
salt winds
blue autumn skies
folded into mountains
purple shadow
night winds blow
on the cabin bed
another quilt
autumn
taking a dirt road
to the end of it
a summer hike
in mountain shadows
finding autumn
clouds
turning off the lights
outside the house
mountain stream
afternoon clouds washed
out to sea
shy before the moon
she too slips behind
autumn clouds
mountain cold
getting under a blanket
to sleep with me
white fish fillet
the sky fills up
with cooler air
after the shower
cool wind in the bathrobe
hangs on a nail
canyon click
nothing on film
like the cold wind
in the dark of night
who would have thought
rain was round
dark castle
atop the mountain
rain clouds
one at a time
rainclouds falling
dark into the sea
rainy night
the path home
a black umbrella
the roof
leaves in a drought year
in the rain gutter
dusk
last light caught
in tears
darkness
the wideness of things
fills the distance
at dusk
voices call out
stars
tangled branches
coming darkness
woven in
a wave breaks white
a gull folds its wing
as the sea darkens
autumn wind
the way it turns things around
at dusk
dusk
the room larger than the persons
filling it
dusk
shaking out the tablecloth
a whir of wings
eclipse
white rocks in the garden
bright round
just now
with the incoming tide
supper time
evenings
the long pale waves
come ashore
evening comes
wrapped in sea fog
tied with webs
evening sea fog
descending into sun-dried grass
sweaty lovers
evening ebb tide
the beach widens
into a flat sea
evening glow
dark the sea
shot with color
evening
waves come into the cove
one at a time
dust
so fine the evenings
golden air
evening as it is
the light lays hot
upon our eyelids
evening
corners move into the room
blown by dark
evening
in a secret cove
fog bound
evening wind
colors of the day
blown away
evening winds
the tiny bay filled
up to the cliff
somber at eventide
faces in sandstone
approaching autumn
autumn equinox
cool wind comes scented
sun-hot pine needles
autumn equinox
putting porch furniture away
getting it out again
fall equinox sun
coming through cedar box trees
anthology plans
fog moves
as children's hands wave good-bye
Sunday evening
whiteness
fog erasing the landscape
history
sea fog
blowing in the valley
shapes of hills
broken fence
river valley fog patches
the gaping holes
sadness
fog leaving
the sea
fog shrouded
a sky without directions
the unknown way
ocean roar
washing dishes
with fog
gray foggy days
womb warm with light filtered
through a membrane
closing
the notebook
fog
more fog
in the notebook
nothing
alone together
behind us fog closed
the Golden Gate
the wind's eye
against the glass
a hurricane
Indian summer
the cold on my teeth
iced tea
moon spirits
the face of the deep
lightly misted
November spirits
playing in the meadow
wisps of mist
rolling hills
hiding stars
in autumn mists
left and right
the moon bounces over
a mountain road
painted hills
the moon of white
is real
moon
full of blue light
desert cool
into valleys
a moon full
of valleys
headed out to sea
the tide-pulling moon
in the rear view mirror
desert tides
the moon shapes
sand stone
a little higher
another valley fills
with the moon
quivering branch
the moon climbs higher
in the old pine
opening the door
for more firewood
there's the moon
from barren trees
shaking wildly
serene moves the moon
fields flat with fog
the radiance of the moon
fenced with rough slats
moonsky
starlight bends and fades
into a halo
higher from earth
the mountain moon
brightens
radiance expands
the moon blows free
of a rumpled earth
white moon
filling the dry valley
with light
in hot springs
the moon warms itself
between us
gurgling
in mineral waters
the moon bathed
each step
up the mountain
the moon whiter
evening mountains
a line of milky blue
round the moon
a rack of clouds
arranged by the moon
in shapes of white
peeking thru pines
bright eye of the moon
my neighbor
crevices
in the face of rock
the moon
full white moon
the colored earth
rolls around
rounding
soft old hills
an ancient moon
moonbeams
the tender roots of passion
flowers
a crescent moon
earth cut off from heaven
by the fog
crescent moon
a bowl of brightness
full of night
hollow
in the dark of the moon
howling
a dark moon
the cold white rim
of an enamel pan
close to my moon
Jupiter with all of his
brightens the night
face of the moon
in the hot tub
a swirl of bubbles
moon clouds
cooling the mountain side
a sunless shape
spotlight
between rocks
a bit of moon
white light
burning up rocks
moon magic
dark world
only rocks bright
where the moon goes
moving rocks
moon rolls over the mountain
none fall
doorknob
the moon looks down
on its tiny self
rocks
piled before the moon
drop back to earth
the full moon
walking the island road
from sea to sea
full moon
ripples reflecting
unseen stars
so full
the moon brightens the room
with poems
all moon
filling the secret cove
with bright water
a full moon
drawing down to the sea
a path of stars
faint with dews
the full moon slides
closer to the sea
full moon
holes in stones
echoes
mountain
giving birth to white light
a round moon
full moon
sculpting sandstone
with light
full moon
letting him in
with the light
full moon
rising over ash mountains
alkali dust clouds
from earth
a light moon rises
tides
moonrise
in the rear-view mirror
sunset
full moon
covering the long dry valley
with light
desert cool
rising to the full moon
desert pool
a full moon
cutting a lock
from the cowlick
cabin alone
the greater moon waits
our return
a full moon
the crazy neighbor's lights
burn all night
closing a slim book
print shrinks in the face
of a full moon
bending the pine tree
with a windy sound
the full moon
filling the river
the complete moon covers
the hole in the bridge
touching her face
fingerprints on the full moon
clouds
a full moon
resting on hoary frost meadows
tundra swans
full moon moves
from poem to poem
through the pine
round moon
rolling from the ridge
gray stones here and there
harvest moon
watching a mouse hole
the ginger cat
turning out the light
renting the room to the moon
for a night
a hazy moon
steam no longer seen
from the hot tub
clear moon
rising from a mountain ridge
darkness on its face
smudged moon
marked by mountain fires
soot and smoke
a hunter's moon
the o's of howling dogs
ring in the mists
late rising
the lop-sided moon
half the night
night
without poems
then comes the moon
late moon
in the poor part of town
second-hand light
the tiny dawn
pine mountain releases
the late moon
ripe huckleberries
the moon comes up
streaked with purple
late moon
shivering before mountains
cold knees
a falling star
the nearly round moon
still not full
clear night
moonlight coats
feathers
brushing moonlight
across night skies
wispy clouds
moonlight
on the way to dawn
vivid dreams
green water
curls into white foam
moonlight
pale violet sheets
in silver moonlight
native hills
moonlight
in the high desert
a river
moonlight
faces in the sandstone cove
laughing
one half a cup
of low-fat cottage cheese
in the moonlight
a window slants
from a rough stone fireplace
a square of moonlight
dancing around
in the moonlight
outstretched hands
nothing moves
moonlight touching wind
chimes
containing
a dish of moonlight
ritual salt
moonlight radiance
behind clusters of dark pine
white clouds
beach sand
wet with moonlight
ebb tide
moonlight
following raccoons
across the porch
alone
how cold the moonlight
on my bed
sitting in moonlight
the empty chair full
of radiance
in my bed
a spot of moonlight
the empty pillow
out to cool
on the porch cakes frosted
with moonlight
promontory
holding up moonlight
crevices of sea caves
moonlight
clothes from the dryer
fresh and clean
moonlight
slipping from her breasts
the white blanket
covered with moonlight
the face of the mountain
my wrinkles
a rock fantasy
shaped by moonlight
fears
moonlight highway
yellow crossing yellow
line of pee
mountain road
winding road
with a yellow line
mountain road
the glow in the moonlight
a night snake
moonlight
reflected from rocks
into haiku
a little higher
another valley fills
with moonlight
autumn leaves
arranging on the earth
silver moonlight
glacier-scarred rock
centuries of moonlight
echo
moonlight
in canyon echoes
stars
moonlight
your image on the mountain
echoes forever
eastern peaks
withholding moonlight
echo your voice
moonlight
in the mountain river
stars echo
moonlight
shaped by leaves of gold
silver
mountains
holding up the moonlight
the highest peak
two headlights
four white eyes
of moonlight
moonlight
broken to bits
by fallen leaves
draping moonlight
over your image
a leafless tree
rolling to the crest
moonlight touches each
tree black
autumn
leaves on the earth
silver moonlight
a black stove
warming a square
of moonlight
round rocks
the new moon rises
old
water striders
on a pale pond
moons
cactus spines
above the desert
a slender moon
incoming tide
curves of spindrift flung high
a quarter moon
sewing by hand
slowly it comes together
the half-round moon
quarter moon
on the night table
a book face up
quarter moon
such a face of darkness
yet you go to him
my longing
voices ask the moon
for news of him
awake
waiting for the moon
him
waiting for moonrise
the scribbled haiku
illegible
washing dishes
that half of the moon
makes them shine
mountain winds
half the moon
blown away
reflecting
on the quarter moon
broken granite
alone in the hot tub
the quarter moon seems
only half there
rising
above lava mountains
the cratered moon
sparks
above the rising moon
a plane lands
fire my companion
too faithful to go outside
see the cold moon rise
a rising moon
her scoop-necked blouse
moves with her breath
unable to hold back
moonrise
the cry of pleasure
over mountains
the moon rises roughly
scarred
moon rise
winds from those barren rocks
moving black pines
scratching his back
from crooked pines
rises the moon
pine needles
radiating light from dark limbs
moon rise
moon rise
waiting in darkness
all of us trees
salty sea fogs
on closed meadow flowers
moon rainbows
mountain pass
night's bright rainbow
a haloed moon
full moon
in a veil of clouds
round rainbows
moon shadows
writing letters deep
into the night
in my moon shadow
the neighbor's gray cat
warms itself
moon shadows
when the wispy clouds
blow free
moon shadow
curving into darkness
fear
moon shadows
writing in a journal
daydreams
darkness
sinking into the sea
craters of the moon
stars scattered
a few fishing boats gather
by the sinking moon
showers pass
on each dark stone
a tiny round moon
moon set
now it's right - how it fits
Half Moon Bay
full the moon
setting into the sea
earth fragrance
midnight
the full moon shines
a bit flat
going out to sea
the moon fills spaces
with my eyes
growing bright
a fog bank at sea
melts the moon
night cooler now
the moon has slipped
into the sea
guiding the moon
into the sea
boat lights
pulling its path
down into the sea
the sinking moon
a brightness
smudging the night
the moon is gone
easing the moon
into gentle seas
your snoring
among starfish
the changing moon sinks
into the sea
moonset at dawn
the sea floor dark
and without water
cold moon
slipping into the sea
the octopus' eye
damp and dim
half the moon
in the water
scattering bright stars
the spent moon sinks
into the sea
bending down
sea clouds slip free
once more the moon
drawn to the porch
by the gold of the moon
sinking into the sea
a huge white wave
the foam becomes
the sinking moon
the moon has set
a cold smell
in the fireplace
shivering
the moon sinks
into cold seas
moon set
a glass of milk
to stay awake
Grand Canyon
cold to the rim
moon snow
moon valleys
shimmering in the shadows
beads of light
waning
the moon comes north
enters my window
ebb tide
the moon and anemone
no longer round
down the highway
the waxing moon comes
to Half Moon Bay
rising
out of the weight of mountains
moon and cool breeze
flying by
the wind-swept moon
bent pines
spinning
out of the mountain's darkness
white moon winds
moon wind
the full radiance sails
from the rippled ridge
pine-needle clusters
redrawing the moon
each gust of wind
autumn morning
a torn shoulder muscle
wakes first
eastern peaks
autumn stains the morning sky
red and gold
first cold dawn
using my old straw hat
to start the fire
morning dews
coming out a cedar house
the whole forest
autumn storms
shaking moonlight
from leaves
thunder
neighbor with a leaky roof
nails faster
before the storm
sunset clouds too
all mixed up
full storm fury
the quarter moon beams down
just quiet
such a storm!
on the roof are falling
all the stars
sea-storm clouds
bodies by Michaelangelo
ring the horizon
out of storm
heavy clouds letting down
night
moon halo
keep us safe
from tomorrow's storm
talk of war
unpredicted a storm
blows in
dim stars
in the same sky
bats hiding
hidden in one palm
hundreds of bats
at the oasis
last light of day
into the clearing curves
the first bat
dipped in dark
bats streak
twilight skies
flying with him
red spots on the shoulders
of the black bird
an old yellow cat
paws tucked under her chest
waiting for a mouse-moon
the cicada's cry
leaves in the maples
brittle gold
cicadas
as if they'd won
a poetry contest
red-eyed cicada
wet from molting
softer than their cry
beached boat
each rib extended
by a cormorant
setting sun
blocked out by cows
following it home
cracked stones
a coyote's howl
widens the gap
Joshua trees
ragged in night skies
a coyote's cry
light
in the coyote's eye
playing tricks
cold wind ruffles
breast feathers of a gray bird
rumors of war
lightning flash
into the sound of rain
a cricket shrills
nights
where you touched me
a cricket chirps
parental home
several crickets
keeping house
slower pulse
of an autumn evening
crickets
the candle dims
a creaking door cricket
changes form
a crow's wing tips
sweeps from the clouds
dark rain drops
crow wings
roughened by wind
ridged by a cliff
crows landing
autumn descends early
in a valley town
two crows
chasing each other
twilight
ebb tides
a flock of crows pulled
from sea caves
crow in rocks
a crack of black quartz
holds a nest
a light rain
not falling in places
the crow flies
Death Valley
the crow stands beside
his shadow
hard black white
sun on the crow's wing
before darkening trees
a crow cawing
so he too has swallowed
a fish bone
translating
Japanese into English
crows
a calling of crows
crisscrossing the air
dark streaks flap
a bending of leaves
as a deer in passing
a sound
steepening the hillside
deer nibble wild flowers
above the autumn sea
deer hunters
soft brown eyes
reflecting blue
in velvet
the deer with his look
of questions
deer hunters
guns leaning against the sky
blue eyes
dead grass
deer bones
exposed
from the cabin
smells of supper cooking
a deer nibbles grass
frost and moonlight
separated
a dark deer shape
becoming
hillside bushes
deer
bronze bracken
the downed deer
not found
a boy watching
a deer dying
turns with a jerk
a stag's cry
a human voice
echoes in me
lovesick
one wild deer
in me
calling
the cry of deer
human desire
also in meditation
to the river bank deer
come down to drink
moonlight
making in her snowy belly
wild-doe milk
evening wind roars
still the nearby stag
hears my uneven breath
trudging up the path
where the hill is the steepest
a dragonfly
bridging worlds
the grass stalk bent
by the dragonfly
dragonflies
giving to their wings
afternoon skies
lantern light
voices in the grass
ring my shadow
at our farewell
insects chirp in the grasses
our lips dry
a jackal howls
a black mountain opens
moon light doors
sun in darkness
monarch butterflies
orange and black
flight of a bird
unmarked
a feather falls
high in autumn
a dark bird struggles
against the wind
pelicans gathered
ready to journey south
my bag is packed
migrating ducks
changing colors of the lake
to autumn
desert lake
roosting place
for water chickens
floating on the lake
the human voices
of ducks
dusk
horizon drawn by a line
of ducks
an owl hoots
the autumn wind blowing
through the o's
flying
in a dream an owl
leaves a cry
the moon rises
day fades into the sound
of owl feathers
dark trees
as a pheasant's call
night fall
liberated
the peasant hen
leaves the cock
picking grass seeds
how lightly quail go
over the land
the female quail
only there
when she moves
quail crossing
hill to hill
a shaft of sunlight
rolling
a flock of quail
on the run
eating the quail
that ate the peas
planted for winter
shadows moving
the forest floor turns
to quail
a mother quail
followed by her fifteen
separate shadows
stolen plums
rounding out the tummies
of raccoon
aware
raccoons on the porch
in my sleep
a dream of bears
raccoon on the porch
peek in the window
red upon red
dragonflies chasing
autumn
smoked salmon
a harvest moon rises
in autumn haze
smoked salmon
evening sky invites
the neighbors in
middle of the night
where scorpions creep
in cracks
knitting needles
the clack of scorpions
mating
a piece of night
breaks off to strike
a scorpion
lightning strikes
at the door a scorpion
tries to get in
unable to work
the scorpion and I stare
at each other
on his back
the scorpion's mate
dead
wood on wood
the dry scrap of scorpions
crawling between
newborn
flies on the beach
dark damp sand
following
a vein of quartz the eye
of a spirit hawk
up the tree
the squirrel stops at the sign
"vote for supervisor ..."
a gray squirrel
tire tracks
in his wet fur
termite tunnel
curved by a cypress
long in the wind
rising from roots
winged termites
rusty as redwoods
wild turkey's cry
in the cabin at dusk
a door closes
undulating
backs of wild turkeys
blown sea oats
vulture feather
white downy fluff
at the shaft
nude sun worshipper
the vultures circle
the old woman
a band of sunlight
on the vulture's wing
a feather missing
tangled branches
vulture shadows
on the darkening
last light
out of the cove
a dark bird
oak grove picnic
slow sound of our chewing
acorns falling
jokes in an oak grove
as acorns fall down
over our laughing
dad on high
dropping from his trees
apples for lunch
southern sunset
filling the apple bin
a deeper red
applesauce
the cinnamon glow
of a kerosene lamp
windfall apples
palaces for worms
American pie
dad gone two years
still he cares
with apples/pears
baskets in a row
overflowing with apples
on one a sweater
straight falling rain
tiny lakes upon the tree
stem hollows of apples
broken by the storm
the asters' fragrance rises
out of damp earth
amid bare bushes
the flash of a woman's flanks
squatting to pee
darkness
winding the river road
bare trees
roots in the sky
the bare tree turns
an upside down day
abandoned orchard
bare branches
full of apples
hidden all summer
among the oak branches
my neighbor's house
autumn storm
the neighbor closer
by a bare tree
from the wind
the flute lesson
of a bare tree
a frosty night
in all the trees
such a letting go
autumn
the bloodless wounds
of farewell and leaves
touching a tree
in palm the sound
of its bark
picking berries
the brown bear
of a neighbor
autumn sun
lying in brown bracken
both of us
mountain spring
a fall of fern
in autumn
leaving new friends
to return home among
dried sword ferns
higher education
from the school yard
these two buckeyes
an old friend
chinquapin burrs open
on smooth fruits
cactus patch
enlightenment comes with
getting the point
at the point
of enlightenment
holy cross cholla
chestnuts we gathered
as they warm the memories
of Italian sunshine
meeting an old friend
chestnut burrs pressed
in our folded hands
falling down
the mums not picked
because you are gone
autumn rain
above the dialysis machine
a withered mum
frost-tipped mums
gathered in withered arms
with black sleeves
all in black
she stoops to save
frost-tipped mums
chrysanthemums
with them in the room
I cannot close my eyes
fall fashions
the tweedy patterns
in cotton fields
canyon crevice
out of red rock water flows
into a golden tree
cottonwood
in the leafless limbs
starlings
autumn evenings
cottonwood trees
seem too cool
cottonwood trees
the dry sound of rain
along the river
at the oasis
wearing the coolness
of willow and cottonwood
late rains
high in a river tree
autumn gold leaves
river of gold
sunning with cottonwoods
Virgin River
harvest moon
a bulging corn crib
releases it
small weeds
finding shadows
for the night
autumn
down the length
of tall grass
dried weeds
a nameless spider
loses his shadow
wild squaw grass
wind twining the slenderness
with shafts of sunlight
withered grass
a crow stretches his eye
over hanging heads
ridge top
burnished grasses
the monk's pate
"Dear Mom"
her letter on a driftwood stick
washed out to sea
the way the ocean 
arranges driftwood logs
on a deserted beach
driftwood
bright with burning
stars
Sunday visitors
admiring sculptured driftwood
in the town square
high tide
the secret script of driftwood
writing itself
driftwood
silver sea mists
petrified
on the island
no one goes to
driftwood
falling
down all sides of the mountain
leaves
nude in the river
a dirty old leaf
touches my thigh
very drunk
bright leaves
fall into a heap
a gust of wind
tossed back into the sky
fallen leaves
in frozen mud
the imprint of a long leaf
lying somewhere else
on the ground
leaves from one tall tree
three inches deep
a swimming hole
filled with the cold
of fallen leaves
drawing boats
on each leaf
ribs in water
sound
from the lizard's voiceless throat
dry leaves
among fallen leaves
a voice from the neighbor's yard
scraping cement
autumn
mountain climbers
one leaf falls
cloves of garlic
arguing voices
braided together
old-timers
finding golden autumn
most lovely
blown leaves
turning the sunlight
from green to gold
riversong
wind blown from autumn trees
a stream of gold
autumn leaves
along with with sunset
a blaze of glory
weeping rock
in autumn dried leaves
gold
low autumn sun
rolling over red rocks
golden trees
late rains
high in a river tree
autumn gold leaves
nearness of hills
undulating in the garden
tufts of heather
patchwork quilt
the rumpled beds
of heather
picking huckleberries
afterwards the lessons
in braille
huckleberries
in her smile
purple teeth
huckleberries
in redwood shadows
round and tart
mountain evening
in a huckleberry sky
the smell of pie
into autumn trees
a rain-wet road winds
sky colors
autumn hills
a mountain of leaves
down from maples
Vermont trip
maples color the back roads
of California
maples
because they are admired most
when their leaves are old
autumn colors
in a redwood grove
one maple afire
stone lantern
dark before the flaming
maple
looking closely
under the mushroom
a desert landscape
woman in the woods
touching mushrooms
touching the base
teary halos
round the moon
onion rings
cutting an onion
all the halos
fall in the soup
sun from the sea
swept up the hills
with pampas grass
pampas grass plumes
the color calls from the west
autumn winds
ribbons of moonlight
glowing out of the earth
pampas grass
salt in a cellar
at seven the mirror frame
a mottled pear
pears
coloring themselves
the days of summer
persimmons
their roundness softens
rice stubble
red-breasted birds
among ripe persimmons
hiding from the cold
fallen plums
at the end of the dog's nose
cold and wet
under dark earth
dusty white potatoes
the moon rises
grins
harvested
pumpkins
a redwood falls
the air of heaven
laid low
giant forest
approaching night
in the redwoods
without a step
giant redwoods going
up the mountain
redwood roots
the base thickens
enters the earth
redwoods
her inheritance
with wind in it
running up and down
the tallest redwood
only my eye
volcanic ash
three and a half million years old
saving the redwoods
redwoods cathedral
darkening the apse
a circle of trees
in a tower
redwoods still growing
shelter
among these redwoods
growing old seems
rather honorable
evening stretches
over desert gold
purple sage
Cathedral Canyon
under Christ's picture
wild sage
fire red
without its flower
the smoke tree
smoke trees
rising to sound
in high caves
braided rice straw
I find a photo
of your lover
in back of the school
yellow leaves of sycamore
an acid burn
tar weeds
along the road
covered with it
alone
picking green tomatoes
before the frost
sea oats
bent by the north wind
barely ripens
strange land
hanging in mid-air I am
as leaves in the larch
leaves caught
in cages of limbs
escape
bent grass
the shape of the apple tree
in brown leaves
before falling
dusty yellow leaves
freshened by rain
leaves fall
the air filled
with church bells
fruitless vines
going out of their way to repair
the broken wicker chair
driftwood
taking root in the river
vines
autumn sun
under willows
a yellow leaf
