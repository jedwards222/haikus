swollen
the amaryllis bud
already red
low-slanted sun
in the red amaryllis
turning on lights
live oaks
changing their shapes
the fog
leaving the light
trunks of tall trees
sink into roots
in the clearing
hovering a circle of trees
their halos
bare trees
hidden in purple vapor
swollen buds
German gray
decorated with snow
popsicle trees
wood smoke
shaping the radiant bodies
of trees in winter
melted snow water
trickling over the veins
of a dried beech leaf
crossed at the ankles
her lovely legs
among young birches
birches
in the beveled glass
winter
snow rain
the thin birch branches
so very slender
white birches
black and white in snow
at lava point
the fire dies
among naked birches
burned bones
black forest
night extinguishes
the snow
sun and snow
still in the pines
the black forest
rusty red the bracken
its shape lost as the cold
takes the bird's wing
winter bracken
frail hands push aside
a garden path
after the storm
rain covers the scar
a branch blown away
whalebone tree limb
to rock this child
the sun's passing
winter freeze
buds of passion flower
faint with pink
rhododendron park
buds too
closed till spring
silence
of winter leaves
tightly rolled buds
bent cedars
facing north all night
snow-covered
before rice shoots
in paddy ponds the tips
of ancient cedars
low clouds
bending cedar tips
rain
mountain winds
from the unseen temple
cedar incense
cementing
the cedars in place
sea fog
rooted in rocks
winter rains
twist a cypress
sky calligraphy
the pruned cypress
grown tall
her tinkling laugh
dried weeds stiff
with ice
thin dune grass
weaving winter sunshine
warm into the wind
white rim
of wild winter seas
withered grass
water music
sea winds scraping
frozen grass
seeds scattered
around the evergreen trees
a complete circle
silver tipped
snow deepening
fir silence
well watered
the hothouse violet
withers
storm seas
tearing from sea cliff rocks
ice plants
granite boulders
footprints from dancing
covered with lichens
spaced out
tiny manzanita flowers

bouncing
out of manzanita bushes

stronger white
blossoms remaining
after the hailstorm
resort in winter
the black fountains
of oaks
wrinkles in hills
shadows of crooked branches
of barren oaks
all their halos
falling in the soup
onions
pulling onions
sea fog drift apart
neighbors come by
red candle
holding a bunch of oranges
for the winter sun
winter sun
wet silk folded
in an orange
winter storms
as plumes of surf rise
pampas grass nods
red-breasted birds
among ripe persimmons
hiding from the cold
north wind
spinning snow blossoms
into bare plum
snowfields
black pine roots twist
a dark stream
scrawny pines
all twigs and branches
in scanty snow
a crowing crow
up the canyon a wind
sharp pine fragrance
cliff hanging
in a gnarled pine
crooked sunshine
alive again
morning sun
on the dead pine
snow-bending
pine boughs
drifted
crossing to the island
pines have arrived
before us
deep in the forest
the taper of pines
brightens the clearing
high principles
inner power of pine trees
reaching the sky
pine needles
sticking into the fog
raindrops
moving around
the wind in the pines
comes home
snow-covered pines
Yosemite Falls
in white water plumes
wind fury
in its shape
a crooked pine
shadow of a tall pine
sweeping an arch
low around the earth
a split rock
pine shadow
slips in
sighing
wind takes from pines
their history
spindrift
hangs in shore pines
moss
wisps of fog
writing Persian poetry
with the pine
bright red leaves
held so high by a winter stem
poinsettia
country Christmas
under a sprinkle of stars
stringing popcorn
rain in the reeds
in her mind the river flows
backwards
withered reeds
all bent one way
by ice
even colder
the breath of the north wind
between broken reeds
meandering stream
dark amidst the snow
twisted roots
winter willows
a vase full of roots
rain runs from
the meekness
of trees with roots exposed
the icy creek
mountain pines
moving as I walk
these rootless things

sweetened with snow
plump flowers
sage brush blooms
five inches of snow
purified
cleaner
on the sagebrush
snow

snow-melt
speaking to noble sequoias
in whispers
giant sequoia roots
running away
in a snow-melt stream
fantasy
in an old sequoia
a brown bear
standing alone
the elegance of sequoia
balanced
giant sequoia
a finger counting rings
touches history
keeping cameras away
the imperial height
of sequoias
running water
giant sequoia roots
not moved
sequoias
their tallness presses
roots in rocks
sequoias
their roots
rocks
Yosemite
after all the waterfalls
uplifted by sequoias
2000 year old tree
it should live forever
whispers a child
snow-melt stream
the sound of giant sequoias
growth
cinnamon red
the last rays of sun
in fragrant trees
cinnamon red
the fragrance of sequoia
in the color
on the wooden path
old folks walk slowly
among ancient trees
on frozen snow
still warm from the cow barn
broken straw
surrounding a tree
the puzzling shapes
of sugar-pine bark
tumbleweeds
piled against barbed wire
snow's lacy patterns
winter rain
on Holland's tulip spears
empty rooms
vines
against a brick schoolhouse
clinging snow
small bushes
cover the desert floor blue
winter sunset
up to a branch
wind took a winter leaf
let it fall again
snow
cooling the colors
withered leaves
frost spikes
the growing cold
of withered leaves
cows in the barn
the wet eye in the meadow
frozen shut
tall tales
of bears on the ridge
a garbage can tips
winter day
as a hairless bear
sleeping sleeping
flying from the branch
sun in a bird's wing
a shower of snow
blackbirds leaving
on bare winter wands
pussy willows
winter birds
kicking down fireworks
from snowy twigs
arranged
on bare branches
bird songs
bare branch
extended by a bird
in flight
river clouds
clots of black birds
darken the sky
a flutter of wings
yet the bare branch
stays bent
story of a life
in a foreign language
nut hulls on melting snow
drawing cliffs
a black bird
the brush
feathered wing
tips jagged sea
rocks sharp north wind
mirrored
in a bird cage
a child's face
winter dawn came
as the sound of blowing snow
sleeping birds
thin wet snow
the warm wiggle within
a cocoon
what dreams
holding on one's lap
a sleeping cat
dreaming
her quivering paws
still catching mice
into a windy night
the cat takes her cries
to be let in
winter's cat
all of her wants
in my lap
winter stars
cat claws in the screen door
desperately cold
storm wind
in the cat's teeth
meowing
cold
comes to bed at two
the white cat
his dog moves closer
the owner quotes a price
for land and trees
injured dog
all of his words
in one eye
the dog
scratches as owner
his fleas
only vertebrae
the found white flowers
of a pet dog
a barking dog
little bits of night
breaking off
dark voices
of night bushes
a dog barks
a Pekinese
barking at Mozart's aria
then everyone claps
crunch of bones
in the hollow places
between the dog's teeth
retreating waves
a tiny barking dog
has them scared
dolphins
arching rainbows
of opal light
hands in the light
at peace demonstrations
the flutter of doves
eagle soars
beyond boundary lines
a judge on a bench
line of words
holding the day
we saw the eagle
snow white

by cotton fields
nobility
wading in up to their knees

in a tide pool

trout for breakfast
slightly smoked
ripples in water
fish spines
and mine

from the waning moon

caught in summer

cut from the snowy whiteness
nothing lacking
a sneeze
in the old sea gull's
knobby knees
white surf
lining the coast
a band of gulls
screaming
at the booming surf
a band of gulls
silent sea creatures
feeding
the cries of gulls
passing flock
out of a clear blue sky
cry of a lone gull
visiting sea gulls
on a winter beach
an old couple
winter storm
landing with a sea gull
one feather falls free
sea gulls

in blue
sea gulls
lifting from wild surf
spindrift

staring at
a blue heron
deep snow
the horse walks the paths
of summer
a white cloud
hanging on the horse's nose
to keep warm

in the high road sky
before the storm
with the thaw
buckling the old saddle
on a frisky horse
snowbound
black and white horses
stay in the stall
a white stallion
sea fog on snow
suddenly solid
high-tide beach
filling hoof tracks
horses
my new road
violated by a horse
ridden by a stranger
after days of rain
the first sunbeam on the road
a galloping horse
riding in waves
horse tracks on wet sand
scalloping
wet monkey hair
organ grinder's tinkly tunes
in a cold rain
in winter walls
our own mice hoard
the warmth
wind moving grasses
quick as a mouse
stealing seeds
a mouse
immeasurable
in me
the mouse and I share
her nest in the sock drawer
my house in the woods
high tide
mussel soup
ready to eat
from his tongue
wind tears the screech
of a snow owl
sea fog wings
over coastal hills
a white owl
moving
a handful of moonlight
the owl's wing
your snoring
the owl answers
some dreams
night skies
on the owl's breast
dawn
Cathedral Canyon
suddenly an Indian maid says
See the white owl?
night skies
under the owl's wing
mouse hearts
ham and beet tops
for dinner our neighbor's
pet pig
solar cells
in polar bear hairs
ice crystals
thawing
the face of the lake
plovers crying
raccoon's silence
emptying garbage can fill
the night with sound

hiding the salamander dreams
up more magic
sandpipers
skimming from the beach
silence

in her mouth melts
hoar frost on grass

from deep in a wolf
into the dark

trapped in my house
I in my realm

coming and going
winter waves
a crust of snow
seaweed flung high
by the night tide

edged with foam
breaking sand
people who die
when the sea is full
a row of foam
beach pebble
round with its years
in the making
waves
break and foam
yet stars
in and out
of the driftwood lair
gull tracks
beach-blown
rainbows in sea foam
sand crystals
a winter's day
suddenly the sun
at a beach picnic
beach laid dark
by low tide now covered
with night waters
high on the hill
the earth smiles
a bay beach
February sun
lying on the nude beach
fully clothed
the swish of surf
falling snowflakes
have a sound
winter beach
in thin white clouds
thoughts of snow
deep in winter
the babbling brook
white as stone
bubbles in ice
holding till spring
the voice of the brook
the mountain brook
still with listening
winter winds
winter warm
red canyon walls hold
the low sun
night mirror
the mouth of a cave
open - pale
frozen cliffs
swept by lighthouse beams
soft in the dark
giant waves
sea cliff rocks
summer sea secure
high tossed mists
warmed in morning sun
above winter cliffs
after the storm
sandstone cliffs relax pebbles
into the beach

brings storm waves
to cliff dwellers

the cliff laced
by crystal
north wind
reducing the cliffs
by a splashed wave
night wheels
the rolling surf
crashes on cliffs

in veins of crystal

winter desert
forgotten the heat
of cinder paths
desert vista
in silence between us
the little heat
windows
in the cinder rocks
wind ohs
the cutting cold
pulled up on a dike
a silver canoe
winter leaves
in the ditch a glove
without a hand
a field of snow
fenced in by fields
of snow
wind-filled snow
now brushing the eaves
now sweeping fields
snowy fields
in a row of winter trees
veins of leaves
the winter moon
diminishing into snowflakes
open fields
fields of bones
beyond the cemetery
white with snow
dark fences
encircling the snowy field
eyelashes blink
snow and moonlight
fill the open field
sky high
snow fields
half-melted
a quarter moon
her long thumbnail
fallow fields lie empty
with snow
stitching together
now-covered fields
blackbird wings
warming
the corner of winter's field
an unattended fire
nuns
all old women who work
fenced in fields
a whiteness
in and out of the woods
as flakes
frost
on the granite
gravel
light spilling
into a waterfall
frost
tiny gardens
huddle together in winter
on the windowsills
glacier gorge
after the snowstorm
empty with light
nap time
warm on a granite wall

glacier
rounding rocks
now a woman
under low clouds

cools the wind
a journey ends
where the glacier melted
a field of stones
granite
without shadow edges
ice on black water
clouds
leaving their shapes
in hills
winter rain
brushing wild hills
a faint green
low winter light
hoarded in red hills
at sunset
crystal waters
warmed with the scent
of earth
ancient earth
tiredness of my old body
in hot springs
winter stars
warmed in mineral baths
foggy
dreams
from hot mineral baths
a bright lava flow
winter night
joining us in the bath
foggy stars
silence
ice all by itself
squeaks
crystals
designed in dark cold time
ice cubes
out of a rock
water flows with history
rimmed with frost
icicles hang
yet above my face
her naked breasts
windless days
surrounding the islands
in deep sleep
winter morning surf
brings to cold sand
a ruddy glow
tapered
the knife lies in the river
an island untouched
red and black
jasper and obsidian
from a volcano
jasper
volcanic gift of healing
from earth fires
fire spirits
gift
jasper nuggets
a glare of ice
to walk without a path

snowstorm
dropping white skies
into a lake
the lake thawing
an image of a woman
awaking
tufa towers
reflecting in the lake
volcanoes
sunrise
burning in the salt sea
a pillar of light
fire spirits
underwater architecture
comes to light
winter-bound peaks
the snow not melted
by our gazing
snow-capped peaks
sun setting fires
with fog-smoke
out of snow
sun sets mountain peaks
a fire
snow-covered
sweet water mountains
rising upward
mountains
folding in the sky
blue snow shadows
north wind
guardian of the narrows
bares the trees
without a guardrail
the tumble-down place
where cars go over
faults
folding mountains
unfolding history
nothing to wear
just clouds
covering mountains
as in the sky
mountain snowfields
trackless
mountain cabin
a wedge of winter sunlight
pushes in the doorway
closing the mind
the sameness of gates
mountain passes
snow blowing
far from the ocean an aching ear
stuffed with cotton
arctic snowfields blow
across sky-blue waters
white caps
where the sun sank
a ship sails cool
on western waters
winter sun
waving the ocean's brightness
a blue-white flag
winter white
on the ocean's block of blue
melting crust of foam
storm-washed sea
each flat wave
a dirty gray
pounding the beach
with storm wild waves
the foghorn
storm waves
falling from angel shoulders
sea spray
all night
the sound of waves
purple silk
cold winter ocean
warms spindrift
in the sun
winter ocean tossing
spindrift over the cliff
into morning sun
curving waves
sleep carries us away
all night
wave songs
pound upon eyelids
sleep
dark blue lines
in a salt sea
dreams
sea ironed black
stars hang at the edge
of winter
ocean waves
and things that sleep
so words can hold them still
kneading dough
silent in the window
wild surf rolls
sea winds
a rush and noise
learned from water
silence
between crashing waves
white foam
a flow of snow
returning the wave
foaming surf
winter waves
playing tag
with old folks
winter waves
crowning plumes
of white spray
a sunny corner
all the winter winds
in white waves
seaside town
emptied at night
by a roaring tide
midnight air

a throbbing
tearing night

morning light
wild surf
on glistening wings
harp rhythms
wild surf
sea and earth
singing air
snowfields
whiteness at high tide
the surf
snowy hill
stretches the unbroken field
curving it just a bit
wild seas
footprints fill
with foam
listening to sea waves
the cup of tea also
tastes cold
surface tension
the smooth ocean
a sacred mirror
snow-covered peaks
covered with blackness
obsidian fields
a peninsula
the gulls carry their name
from sea to sea
land's end
pushing into the sea
white water
the old pond
how snugly it fits
new ice
winter millpond
the moon cuts wavelets
in silver slivers
in time
oars dipping
into winter
upstream
the solstice moon has frozen
the river
sun shine
in a drop of melting snow
the river black
rocks frozen in snow
a lonely woman stares
at the river's cold
snow-capped rocks
above the river's current
nimbus
surf tongue
a whispering roar
in the river's mouth
each day anew
river's mouth finds
the sea
river mouth
rushing to the sea
curves a smile
suspension bridge
so narrow my shadow
waits on shore
his days measured
a river flowing
across the sky
mouth open
dangerous as the river ends
in ocean waves
late leaves
skidding over frozen snow
yesterday's news
bright earth
filling to the ceiling
snow-cold
cushions
on summer chairs
snow
bright aura
everything covered
with snow
mountain air
crystallized by snow
and granite
snow-capped peaks
on the desert floor white clouds
of alkali dust
windowsill
piled with snow
far ridges
almost a mountain
the hills grow up
with snowdrifts
dark place in snow
the bag of coal
now white itself
cloud shadows
the sky's footprints
on mountain snow
cold night
stacks on the woodpile
a cover of snow
snowbound
the lake also
disappeared
snowbound
fire spirits
in a salt lake
snowbound
all the colors
quiet
heart of an agate
slivered with polishing
turns to the sun
a quartz crystal
light years ago
keeping time
facing the sea
weathered rocks of age
wrinkled and gray
painted stones
tree shadows
not moving
bubbling out of the sea
rock burned black
a million years ago
soft round mounting
a rock the sea leaves
it jagged
curved straight
a sea rock spreads
white spray wing
silence of stones
songs sung low
and slow
unheated seas
dark rocks dissolve
into evening mists
high tide
water covers rocks
as sleep
waves breaking
the ragged shore
into sea rocks
white
alone on a dark rock
with small waves
crystal clear
the rainbow colors
of his shining
low winter sun
lights a fire
in a stone circle
wind echo
in round rocks
crystals
desert wash
every sized crystal
clear light
trees
scattered in the soil
petrified
massive rocks
wind sounds pushed
into the pines
shoreline rocks
loosening the wind's roar
from each wave
water dripping
stories etched on rock
howl in the wind
dragon jaw
biting winds claw
off-shore rocks
sun warms rock
winter storms swept bare
of frost flowers
rocks
record players
of time
old society dame
a lifetime of faces
studies the rock
long shadows
stumbling over rocks
on the way home
Death Valley
oldest rocks on earth
writer's block
pushing sunshine
into dark seas
slanted rocks
ancient river
draws a white line
in the tiniest stone
winter carves
in mountain rocks
deep shadow
centuries of stone
your voice echoes
forever
resting on a rock
by a snow-melt stream
winter-cold butt
low tide rocks
bubbling out of the sea
still lava
fog
in the valleys
cold hands
white winds
from snowy peaks
cover the valley
wide desert valleys
push apart peaks
soul bodies
winter shadow
a low mountain fills
the wide valley
icy streets
today of all days
his first steps
half-frozen ice
how the idiot fixes
his wayward feet
roads
in winter
stream
snow-clouds
the cooled fires
of volcanoes
passive
an extinct volcano
covered with snow
fire spirits
making mountains
out of volcanoes
volcanoes
covered with pure clouds
silent fires
jagged peaks
swirling their fires
into clouds
clouds
swirling their fires
into jagged peaks
a brick wall
splintered by frost
back to the earth
orange winter
windows beginning to dream
night fears awaken
river stone house
water pushes snow drifts
into walls
river-rock house
at night the walls
a babbling brook
city walls
of no one
sunless dark
noises
the mossy parts
of a waterfall
snow pond
Yosemite spring time
a waterfall
falling
into water smoke
snow melt
rocks bending
sound paths
of the waterfall
from living rock
the purity of snow
water rises
sunshine
pouring down the canyon wall
snow-melt waterfall
upward spiral
wind pushed the waterfall
into a cloud
sunshine
carves the rock
snow-melt waterfall
moving up
in the falling rain
our empty well
frost sharp air
cut into pieces by sunshine
sparkling on snow
winter air
thick as the branches
bare
gathering clouds
heavy and dark with holding
fallen flakes
low clouds
pressing out of the sea
huge waves
purple lava peaks
rain clouds hovering over
desert sunset
purple peaks
with fire-rimmed steam
sunset clouds
winter clouds
summer dreams
turning to ice
night light
thin cloud cover guides me
across the room
dark on the sea
a rain cloud brushes
the tops of waves
cloud dark
joined to sea dark
by falling rain
roaring down the beach
at the height of winter waves
mist clouds
a curtain pulled back
by a south wind
cold
smooth snow
deeper than garden stones
the cold
beach cold
twisting driftwood
into a windbreak
beach cold
freezing a driftwood
windbreak
winter waves
rolling into sun-warmed sand
driftwood
waves
rolling into frosted sand
winter
winter cold
finding on the beach
an open knife
winter dawn
sounds of blowing snow
sleeping birds
sea dawn
the journey of snowflakes
to a parking lot
clouds resting
on top of snowdrifts
winter dawn
daybreak
glass shatters
the dream
just at daybreak
a drift of snow balanced
on each branch
winter dawn comes
the sound of blowing snow
sleeping birds
falling out
at the crack of dawn
snowflakes
between mountains
and heavy snow clouds
daybreak
frozen sun
dawn's clouds
faint with pink
the skin of our teeth
as thick as a life
a winter day
daybreak
light drifting down
in snowflakes
snow by candlelight
brightens the turn
to shorter days
for tall folks
the hours of light
shortened
slow rains
as if leaves were falling
at winter's end
first light
nudging frozen clouds
snow flakes
star gazing
all the familiar things
in morning's light
milky dawn
the world without color
takes form
spots of blue
varying the light to fit
tracks in the snow
morning light
a couple on the cliff
as spirits of a new day
just now
the moon set
and you sleep
timeless
in the fog
someone walking
foggy night
farm lights of a lonely coast
separate
wrapped in fog
colors of the coast
quiet
fog
edge of the cliff
edge of the world
ocean fog
in the broken sign
open
fog
the days go by
without hours
evening fog
in town with dampened
spirits
mist
broken from night waves
sleep
asleep
fog extends
the morning
foggy morning
coming in the door
weak sunlight
thick swirling fog
not seeing anything
just a wing shape
new flannel gown
wrapped for the night
in thick sea fog
fog
river mouth
bridged
worldly view
obscured by sea fog
angel wings
fingers
into valleys
sea fog
warming
thick fog
a fire
out of fog
fog colors
in waves
into the cove
fog pours
more secrets
cutting out the world
sounds of the sea
fog
erasing the land
the ocean sends a blanket
of fog
neighbors
leaving as
fog
lace edges
the fallen leaf
white with frost
granite patterns
fallen to leaves
frosted rust
flowers blooming
on dry sand and pond
frost
water over ice
floating among clotted leaves
a face expiring
surf sounds
covering the winter porch
a shell of ice
clouds
still in the mountain brook
ice
before they melt
hailstones hiding themselves
in the gravel path
spindrift
falling on the hills
hail
veiled moon
fragments loosen
hail
silence
after the hailstorm
cold
cold
the winter moon with you
at the window
full-moon sky
cold high winds blow
from a bright hole
waning moon watches
a pie put out to cool
eaten away
dark night winds
blowing over the seas
the moon sinks in
the full moon
slips into its silver path
sea sleep
melting into the sea
the full moon
leaves a candle bright
plunging right in
the moon and I
cold night seas
time
on a moonless night
a dog barking
released
from snow-capped peaks
a full moon
cold winds
rounding snow-capped peaks
a full moon
from the full moon
cold summit winds
snow-clad
touching eyes
the whiteness of snow
a full moon
winter moon
directing the winds
around corners
winter's new moon
the cutting cold
shines tonight
high on a cliff
the quarter moon finds
dark houses
wolf moon
slipping into northern pines
winter
winter moonlight
the crystal prism turns
with the tides
mornings
the winter moon leaves
a frosted path
longest night
full moon whitens
pure snow
Northern Lights
a white robed choir sings
to radio static
rattle of rain
across the valley
into my hand
downpour
a basket on the porch
fills with rain
raindrops
inside
heartbeats
after dinner
so full of soup
it begins to rain
to the rocks
the sky falling free
a bluish glow
pale skies
winter comes from afar
a white foam wave
blind smoke
touching the sky
with one finger
wood smoke
pressed to the porch
by low clouds
life
of a snowflake
falling
silence
snowing
light
satisfied
with toast and cocoa
it stops snowing
porch light
brilliant with the points
of falling snow
night light
snow falls
on the porch
rain
silent
snow
the clock ticks
back and forth
snowfall
first snow
deep as a fallen leaf
upright
mountain deep
a sky covering with snow
our way home
blue cold snow
warmed by fallen leaves
russet brown
ticking
each hour
snow deepens
early snow
even in the hole is white
overturned outhouse
to touch stars
her outstretched hand
fills with snowflakes
snowdrifts
flinging moth wings
across the land
melting snow
your tracks leaving
a dampness
melting snow
the white nets hold down
springing grasses
it melts
last light of afternoon
rest of the snow
cap of snow
on the sun-warmed rock
shrinking to fit
new-fallen snow
scraped by wing tips
leaving the earth
new-fallen snow
screams of children
biting cold
crystals
filling the night window
with stars
glistening cold
the stars bend down
a few flakes
snow taste
the cold fire
of frozen stars
high winds
stars moved about
by swaying tress
cold stars
dropping into the ocean
snowflakes
curving the sky
storm clouds arch
into the bay
the winter tempest
visiting the neighbors
how still it is
winter storms
passing the rain rattle
drums on the roof
sea storm
blue black clouds sink
salt-water air
after the snowstorm
new paths to old places
the skies clear
fire on water
reflecting the sun
after a storm
between winter storms
a fisherman come to bring
poems and primroses
after the snowstorm
only wood smoke drifts
into the clearing
snow storm
brings white skies
down to earth
this blizzard
blowing about
one small candle
snow storm
children hanging in a tree
paper flowers
storm winds
in all things that don't die
this quivering
winter storm
tearing the waves white
low-scudding clouds
storm winds
breeze through a cracked window
our nightly breath
storm waves
winter tides wave
to mountain tops
storm clouds
forcing the sun to set
far out to sea
night storm
at sea dark things
move closer
winter storms
wrapping around the house
the ocean's roar
storm sails
cloud evening skies
eyes
winter sun
coming in late
for breakfast
low winter sun
covered with one wave
leaping on the beach
low winter sun
walking the length
of the rock's shadow
midwinter's day
the sun and moon
combine warmth
midwinter's sun
breaking the ice
in a rain barrel
night's warmth
sucked into the sea
a sinking sun
winter twilight
gathers in her lap
white folded hands
blue desert wind
pushes the hills' shadow
the long walk home
ocean
twilight as final
as the last one
alkali flats
in the twilight of evening
snow white
winter wind
a red flag waves
to the whiteness
rock music
the beach house shaken
by howling winds
wind
finding dark places in cliffs
for the night
sea winds
not believing in
the silence
wind
from the mouth of something
dark
a blanket of wind
wrapping around the house
ocean cold
sea foam
pulling storm winds
across the beach
night winds
touching crested waves
with frost
wind tears
smoke from the chimney
snow flakes
Aeolian harps
rigged for sailing
snowfields
tundra wind
in an ancient poet's ears
followers' footprints
snow
lighting the way
of the wind
across the sea
wind blows to me
stranger's snow
riding white roads
before dawn without a steed
winds of winter
crossing the bay
from island to island
winter winds
unseen wind
water touching water
with its roar
wind
tangling bare air
black trees
homeward
wind pushes us across
evening shadows
